Given an open cover $\mathscr U$ of $X$, choose a countable subcollection $\mathscr A$ covering the countable set $\{\omega_1\}\times[0,\omega)$.
The union $\bigcup\mathscr A$ contains all but countably many columns of $[0,\omega_1]\times[0,\omega)$.
Therefore the closure of $\bigcup\mathscr A$ has countable complement $B$ in $X$.
One can then extend $\mathscr A$ to a countable subcollection of $\mathscr U$ that covers $B$.
The union of the extended subcollection is dense in $X$.
