Observe that a (countable) subcollection $\mathscr A$ of an open cover $\mathscr U$
covering the subset $\{\omega_1\}\times[0,\omega)$ contains all but countably many columns of $[0,\omega_1]\times[0,\omega)$.
Therefore its closure has countable complement $B$ in $X$.
$\mathscr A$ can be then extended so that it is still countable and covers $B$.
The union of the extended subcollection is dense.
