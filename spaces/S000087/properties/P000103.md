Assume $A$ is a {P19} subset of $X$. It cannot contain an infinite discrete subset that is closed in $A$.
From that, one can deduce the following facts.
If a column of $A$ (set of the form $A\cap (\{\alpha\}{\times}[0,\omega])$ for some $\alpha<\omega_1$) is infinite,
it necessarily contains the limit point $(\alpha,\omega)$ of that column.
Also, there have to be at most finitely many non-empty such columns (picking a single point from each column leads to a closed and dicrete subset).
And finally, $A$ has a finite intersection with $\{\omega_1\}{\times}[0,\omega)$.
It follows that $A$ is closed as a finite union of closed sets.
