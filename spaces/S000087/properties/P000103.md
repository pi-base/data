Assume $A$ is a {P19} subset of $X$. It cannot contain an infinite discrete subset that is closed in $A$.
Therefore, if a column of $A$ (set of the form $A\cap (\{\alpha\}{\times}[0,\omega])$ for fixed $\alpha<\omega_1$) is inifite,
then it necessarily contains the limit $(\alpha,\omega)$ of said column.
Secondly, there have to be at most finitely many non-empty columns (picking single point from each column leads to a closed and dicrete subset).
From the above properties we deduce that $A$ is closed.
