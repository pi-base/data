The subspace $X$ of {S191} obtained by removing the point $\langle\omega_1,\omega\rangle$.
So $X=(Y\times Z)\setminus\{\langle\omega_1,\omega\rangle\}$ 
where $Y=[0,\omega_1]$ is given the topology with points of $[0,\omega_1)$
isolated and neighborhoods of $\omega_1$ cocountable ({S155}),
and $Z=[0,\omega]$ is given the topology with points of $[0,\omega)$
isolated and neighborhoods of $\omega$ cofinite ({S20}).

Defined as counterexample #89 ("Dieudonné Plank")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}. Note that the pi-Base qualifies this name with
"Deleted" to align with e.g. {S78} and {S79}.
