Let $X=\omega=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$.
A set is closed in this topology if it contains $0$ or is empty.

Defined as counterexample #14 ("Countable Particular Point Topology")

<!-- [[Proof of Topology]]
To prove the first condition, note that $X\in \tau$ by definition. Now, note that $\emptyset \subset X$ and $p\notin \emptyset$. It follows that $\emptyset \in \tau$.
Now to prove the second condition, consider $\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$ where $I$ is some arbitrary indexing set. It follows that there are two cases, either $p\in \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$ or $p\notin \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$. For the case in which $p$ is in the union, it must be the case that $X$ is in the union, because the only open set containing $p$ is $X$. It follows then that the union is $X$. So in this case, the second condition holds. To prove the second case, when $p$ is not in the union, we simply have an arbitrary union of subsets of $X$ which must be a subset of $X$ that does not contain $p$. So, the second condition holds for this case.
To prove the final condition, consider $\bigcap_i^n U_i$. Again, there are two cases here, either $p$ is in the intersection, or it is not. For when $p$ is in the intersection, note that every open set other than $X$ does not contain $p$. So for $p$ to be in the intersection, it must be the case that $X$ is the only set in the intersection and thus it is open. Now if $p$ is not in the intersection, it must be a subset of $X$ that does not contain $p$. So in both cases, the intersection is open, and thus the final condition holds and $\tau$ is a topology on $X$.
