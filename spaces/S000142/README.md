The subspace $X$ of $\ell^2$ consisting of those sequences $x=(x_i)_i$ with all $x_i\in\mathbb Q$.

The space $\ell^2$ is the Banach space of sequences of real numbers $x=(x_i)_i$ with $\Sigma_i x_i^2<\infty$,
equipped with the norm $\|x\|_2=(\Sigma_i x_i^2)^{1/2}$ and corresponding distance and topology.

The space $\ell^2$ is topologically homeomorphic to {S30};
but note the space $X$ is *not* homeomorphic to the subspace $\mathbb Q^\omega$ of $\mathbb R^\omega$.
