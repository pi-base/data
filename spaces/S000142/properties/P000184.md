There is a homeomorphic embedding of $X$ into $\mathbb R^2$.  See sections 1.2.15 and 1.4.6 in {{zb:0401.54029}} for details.

The idea is to consider the map $\varphi:X\to\mathbb Q^\omega\times\mathbb R$ defined by $\varphi(x)=(x,\|x\|)$, where $\mathbb Q^\omega$ in the codomain has the product topology.  The map $\varphi$ is continuous and injective.  And it is a homeomorphism onto its image.  This follows from the fact that both domain and codomain are metric spaces, and a sequence $(x_n)_n$ of points in the Hilbert space $\ell^2$ converges to the point $x\in\ell^2$ iff $x_n$ converges componentwise to $x$ and $\|x_n\|\to\|x\|$ (see for example {{mathse:1326803}} and {{mathse:214248}}).  Finally, use the fact that $\mathbb Q^\omega$ is {P53}, {P26} and {P50}, and {T462}.
