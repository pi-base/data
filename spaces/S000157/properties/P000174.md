  name: Why does the union of a chain of countable sets have cardinality at most $\aleph_1$?
---

Suppose by contradiction that $X$ is well-based at the point $p$.
So there is a chain (totally ordered by inclusion) of neighborhoods of $p$ forming a local base at $p$.
Their complements form a chain $\mathscr C$ of countable subsets of $X\setminus\{p\}$ whose union is $X\setminus\{p\}$.
But this is impossible since, as shown for example in {{mathse:342091}}, $|\bigcup\mathscr C|\le\aleph_1<\aleph_2$.
