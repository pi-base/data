Given Separated sets $A$ and $B$, now see that $O_A = A \cap C_1$ and $O_B = B \cap C_1$ are subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and since $O_A$ and $O_B$ are separated thus we can find disjoint neighborhoods in $\mathbb{R}^2$ $U_A$ and $U_B$ in $C_1$ respectively. Now given any point a in $O_A$, a has an open set $U_a$ which is disjoint from B and can be chosen such that $U_a \cap C_1 \subset U_A$ and similarly for any point b in $B \cap C_1$ we can find a disjoint open set $U_b$ from $A$ and $U_b \cap C_1 \subset U_B$. Now since $A \cap C_2$ and $B \cap C_2$ are open we can get open sets $(A \cap C_2) \cup (\bigcup\limits_{a \in A} U_a)$ and $(B \cap C_2) \cup (\bigcup\limits_{b \in B} U_b)$ which are disjoint and contain $A$ and $B$ respectively.
