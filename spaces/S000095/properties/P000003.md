We will prove that the Concentric Circles Topology is $T_2$ by cases. There are four cases.
Case one both a and b are on $C_1$ thus if we find the radial distance from a to b on $C_1$ and then take half the distance and call that distance $\epsilon$ the create $V_{\epsilon}(a)$ and $V_{\epsilon}(b)$ these two sets are disjoint and and open on $C_1$ when also projected onto $C_2$.
Case two a is on $C_1$ and b is the radial projection of a onto $C_2$. find any open set on $C_1 $ where a is the midpoint and the set containing b on $C_2$ these two sets are disjoint and open.
Case three a is on $C_1$ and b is not the radial midpoint of a onto $C_2$. first we find the pre-image j of b in $C_1$ find the radial distance between a and j then multiply that by two and call that $\epsilon$ the take the epsilon neighborhood around j and the set containing b on $C_2$ these are two disjoint open sets containing a and b respectively.
Case four both a and b are on $C_2$ this is trivial and just take the sets only conaining a and b respectively.
Therefore the concentric circles Topology is $T_2$.
