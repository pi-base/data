$A\subset X$ is called *$\theta$-discrete* if every point of $X$ has a closed neighbourhood containing only one point of $A$. Symbol "$\theta$" in the name does not formally refer to to the irrational constant.

By Theorem 1 in {{zb:1453.54006}}, every bijection between $\theta$-discrete subsets of $X$ extends to a homeomorphism of $X$.

It can be readily verified that $Z=\mathbb Z\times\{0\}$ is $\theta$-discrete (every discrete closed subset contained in $\mathbb Q\times\{0\}$ is) and admits continuum bijections to itself (e.g. every subset of $Z$ can be the set of fixed points),
hence there exist uncountably many self-homeomorphisms of $X$.
