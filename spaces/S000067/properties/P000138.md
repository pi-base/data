Following the terminology used in {{zb:1453.54006}}, a set
$A\subset X$ is called *$\theta$-discrete* if every point of $X$ has a closed neighbourhood containing only one point of $A$. (The symbol "$\theta$" here has nothing to do with the irrational constant used to define {S67}.)

By Theorem 1 in that paper, every bijection between $\theta$-discrete subsets of $X$ extends to a homeomorphism from $X$ to itself.

The set $\mathbb Z\times\{0\}$ is $\theta$-discrete (every discrete closed subset contained in $\mathbb Q\times\{0\}$ is) and admits continuum many bijections to itself (e.g. every subset of $Z$ with at least two elements in its complement can be the set of fixed points).
Hence there exist uncountably many self-homeomorphisms of $X$.
