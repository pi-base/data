Observe that if Player 1 chooses $x_n\notin \mathbb Q$ then the Player 2 wins by picking $V_n=\{x_n\}$.

For rational $x_n$, Player 2 chooses $V_n$ to be any open interval around $x_n$ with closure contained in $U_n$ and of length less than $2^{-n}$.
In the game played according to this strategy,
$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n$ equals the intersection of some descending family of closed intervals (compact sets in the Euclidean topology) and is therefore non-empty.
