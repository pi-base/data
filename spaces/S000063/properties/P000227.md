Let $\{q_n: n\in\mathbb N\}=\mathbb Q$.
Consider the closed set
$L = \mathbb R\setminus \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N} (q_n-2^{-n},q_n+2^{-n})$.
It is discrete, as a subset of the irrational numbers.
Since the Lebesgue measure of $L$ is infinite (its complement is of finite measure), $L$ is uncountable.

As $L$ is also closed in Euclidean topology, any uncountable closed set in Euclidean topology is of cardinality $\mathfrak c$, by Cantor–Bendixson theorem.
