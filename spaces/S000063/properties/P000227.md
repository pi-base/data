  name: Bijection between closed uncountable subset of $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb R$
---

Let $\{q_n: n\in\mathbb N\}=\mathbb Q$.
Consider the set
$L = \mathbb R\setminus \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N} (q_n-2^{-n},q_n+2^{-n})$,
which is closed in {S25} and hence closed in the finer topology of $X$.
It is discrete in $X$, as a subset of the irrational numbers.
And it is uncountable since its Lebesgue measure is infinite (its complement is of finite measure).
Since every uncountable closed set in {S25} has cardinality $\mathfrak c$
(consequence of the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, see for example {{mathse:740095}}),
it follows that $|L|=\mathfrak c$.
