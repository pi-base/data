The seubset $A=\mathbb Q+\sqrt{2}$ is open and $F_\sigma$ in $X$, therefore a cozero set, since {S63|P7}.

Suppose $B$ is a cozero set disjoint from $A$ such that $A\cup B$ is dense. Since $\mathbb Q\subset \overline{A}$, we have $B\subseteq\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$.
By the density of $B\cup A$ we know that $A\cup B=\mathbb R\setminus \mathbb Q$ and consequently, the irrationals are
$F_\sigma$. Since neighbourhoods of rational numbers always contain the Euclidean ones, it would imply $\mathbb Q$ is a $G_\delta$ subset of {S25},
contradicting the Baire category theorem.
