Let $D=\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$, the set of irrational numbers.
The space $X$ is $\mathbb R$ with the topology generated by the Euclidean open sets
together with all singletons $\{x\}$ for $x\in D$.
(So any subset of $D$ is open in $X$.)

The topology is finer than {S59}.

The use of this space by [Ernest Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Michael) in {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1963-10931-3}} resulted in it being known as the "Michael line".
See for example <https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/michael-line-basics/>.

Defined as counterexample #71 ("Discrete Irrational Extension of $\mathbb{R}$")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
