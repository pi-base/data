If $X = \mathbb{R}$, and if $D$ is a dense subset of the Euclidean space $(X, \tau)$ with a dense complement, we define $\tau^{*}$, the discrete extension of $\tau$, to be the topology generated from $\tau$ by adding each point of $D$ as an open set. (Then any subset of $D$ will be open in $\tau^{*}$.) The Discrete Irrational Extension of $\mathbb{R}$ is the space that results when $D = \mathbb{P}$, the set of irrational numbers.

The use of this space by [Ernest Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Michael) in {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1963-10931-3}} resulted in it being known as the "Michael line".  See for example <https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/michael-line-basics/>.
