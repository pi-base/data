Let $A$ be the linearly ordered set $\{1,2,3,\dots,\omega,\dots,-3,-2,-1\}$ with the interval topology. Let $X = A \times \omega \cup \{a, -a\}$ where $a$ and $-a$ are ideal points with neighborhoods $M_n^+(a) = \{a\} \cup \{(i,j)\ |\ i<\omega, j>n\}$ and $M_n^-(-a) = \{-a\}\cup\{(i,j)\ |\ i>\omega,j>n\}$.
