{S75} is {P27}, {P53} and has an [inductive dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_dimension) 2 because:
- For each point in open upper half-plane, it contains a regular basis consists of Euclidean open disks, which has boundary $S^1$.
- For each point $p$ in $x$-axis, it contains a regular basis consists of disks, which has boundary $S^1 \setminus \{p\}$.
