name: One-point compactification of the metric fan

Consider
the set $\omega^2\cup\{\infty_x,\infty_y\}$ with points of
$\omega^2$ isolated, neighborhoods of $\infty_x$ containing
all but finitely-many columns, and neighborhoods of $\infty_y$
containing all but finitely-many rows.

Equivalently, the one-point compactification of {S202}.
