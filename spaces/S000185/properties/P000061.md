Singletons $\{a\}$ with $a\in\omega^2$ are clopen sets, hence cozero sets.
So every subset of $\omega^2$ is a cozero set, as a countable union of cozero sets.

Thus, given a cozero set $A$, the set $B := X \setminus (A \cup \{\infty_1,\infty_2\})$ is a cozero set disjoint from $A$, and $A \cup B$ is dense in $X$ since it contains $\omega^2$.
