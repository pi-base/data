As singletons from $a \in \omega^2$ are connected components, $\{a\}$ is cozero.
So as countable unions of cozero sets are cozero, every subset of $\omega^2$ is a cozero set.

Thus, given a cozero set $A$, $B := X \setminus (A \cup \{\infty_1,\infty_2\})$ is cozero and $\omega^2 \subseteq A \cup B$, which is dense.
