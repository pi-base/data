Let $X_0 = \{(x, t) : x = \pm\alpha, t\in [0, 1), \alpha\in \omega_1\}\cup \{(\omega_1, 0), (-\omega_1, 0)\}$
be the *two-sided closed long line*, which is the compactification of $X=$ {S149}
obtained by adjoining a minimum and a maximum point.

Define $f:X_0\to \prod_{\beta\in\omega_1}\mathbb{R}$ by

$$f(x, t) = \begin{cases}
1_\alpha + t1_{\{\alpha\}}, & x=\alpha\in\omega_1 \\
1_{\omega_1}, & x = \omega_1 \\
-(1_\alpha + t1_{\{\alpha\}}), & -x=\alpha\in\omega_1 \\
-1_{\omega_1} & x = -\omega_1,
\end{cases} $$

Here, for $Y\subseteq\omega_1$ the function $1_Y:\omega_1\to\mathbb R$,
which is an element of $\prod_{\beta\in\omega_1}\mathbb{R}$, is the characteristic function of $Y$.
In particular, for an ordinal $\alpha=\{\gamma:\gamma<\alpha\}$,
$1_{\{\alpha\}}(\beta)=1$ iff $\beta=\alpha$ and $1_\alpha(\beta)=1$ iff $\beta<\alpha$.

The function $f$ is continuous and injective.  Since $X_0$ is compact, $f$ is also closed and hence an embedding.
The restriction of $f$ to $X$ is an embedding into the $\Sigma$-product $W=\Sigma_{\alpha < \omega_1}\mathbb{R}$
and $f(X)$ is closed in $W$.

Since {S25|P76}
and $\Sigma$-products and closed subspaces of {P76} spaces are {P76},
it follows that $X$ is {P76}.
