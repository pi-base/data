Let $X_0 = \{(x, t) : x = \pm\alpha, t\in [0, 1), \alpha\in \omega_1\}\cup \{(\omega_1, 0), (-\omega_1, 0)\}$ be the two-sided closed long line. Define $f:X_0\to \prod_{\alpha\in\omega_1}\mathbb{R}$ by $$f(x, t) = \begin{cases} 1_\alpha + t1_{\{\alpha\}}, & x \in \omega_1 \\ 1_{\omega_1}, & x = \omega_1 \\ -(1_\alpha + t1_{\{\alpha\}}), & -x \in \omega_1 \\ -1_{\omega_1} & x = -\omega_1,  \end{cases} $$ where $1_Y$ for $Y\subseteq \omega_1$ is the characteristic function of $Y$. 
Then $f$ is a continuous closed injective map, and so an embedding. 
The restriction of $f$ to $X$ is a closed embedding into $\Sigma_{\alpha < \omega_1}\mathbb{R}$.

Since {S25|P76} and $\Sigma$-products and closed subspaces of {P76} spaces are {P76}, it follows that $X$ is {P76}.
