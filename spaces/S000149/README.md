This space $X$ is constructed from {S38} with a mirror copy extending in the other direction.

Let $L$ denote the {S38} $\omega_1\times[0,1)$ with the lexicographic order
and let $L^\ast$ be a copy of $L$ with the reverse order.
As an ordered set, $X$ is obtained from $L^\ast$ followed by $L$ with $\max(L^\ast)$ and $\min(L)$ identified.
It is given the corresponding order topology.
