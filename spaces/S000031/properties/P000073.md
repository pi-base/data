If $A\subseteq X$ is irreducible and non-empty, then $A\subseteq \pi_1(A)\times \pi_2(A)$ where $\pi_k$ are projections onto the $k$th coordinate, so $\pi_k(A)$ are non-empty and irreducible in {S29}. Since {S29|P2}, {S29|P73} and irreducible components are closed, the non-empty irreducible subsets of {S29} are singletons so $\pi_k(A)$ are singletons, and so $A$ is a singleton.
