If $A\subseteq X$ is non-empty and irreducible, then $A\subseteq \pi_1(A)\times \pi_2(A)$ where $\pi_k$ are projections onto the $k$th coordinate, so $\pi_k(A)$ are non-empty and irreducible in {S29}. Suppose $B\subseteq \mathbb{Q}\cup \{\infty\}$ is irreducible and non-empty. If there existed distinct $x, y\in B\cap \mathbb{Q}$, then $x, y$ have disjoint neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{Q}$ and so in $B$, and this is impossible since $B$ is irreducible. So $B$ can have at most two points so that $B$ is discrete, and because {S1|P39}, $B$ is a singleton. It follows that $B = \pi_k(A)$ are singletons and so is $A$.
