The set $X=\omega_1+1$ with the topology generated by the base
$\{[\alpha,\omega_1]\setminus F:\alpha<\omega_1,F \text{ finite subset of }X\}$.
The topology is the join in the [lattice of topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_of_topologies) on $X$ of
(1) the cofinite topology and
(2) the topology with base consisting of the rays $[\alpha,\omega_1]$ for all $\alpha<\omega_1$ (but not $\alpha=\omega_1$).

A related example was constructed by Isbell in section 2 of
{{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1987-0891170-3}}
as an example of a {P130} space which is not {P141}. We make it {P2} by applying section 3 of the same article.
