---

The set $\omega_1+1$ with the topology generated by the basis
$\{[0,\omega_1)\setminus F:F\text{ finite}\}\cup\{[\alpha,\omega_1]\setminus F:\alpha<\omega_1,F\text{ finite}\}$.

Constructed by Isbell in
{{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1987-0891170-3}}
as an example of a {P130} space which is not {P141}.
