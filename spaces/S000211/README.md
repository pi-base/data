The set $\omega_1+1$ with the topology generated by the basis
$\{[\alpha,\omega_1]\setminus F:\alpha<\omega_1,F\text{ finite}\}$.

A related example was constructed by Isbell in section 2 of
{{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1987-0891170-3}}
as an example of a {P130} space which is not {P141}. We make it {P2} by applying section 3 of the same article.
