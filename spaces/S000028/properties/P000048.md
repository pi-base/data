To show the space is totally separated, suppose we are given distinct irrationals $x$ and $y$.  We must find disjoint open sets such that $x$ is in one set and $y$ is in the other, and the union of the two sets is the set of irrational numbers.    Because the rationals and irrationals are dense on the real line, we can find a rational number $q$ between $x$ and $y$.  Now we separate the irrational numbers by $\mathbb{I} \cap ( - \infty , q)$ and $\mathbb{I} \cap (q , \infty)$. Since $q$ is rational, any irrational belongs to one of these two sets. Therefore, the irrational numbers are totally separated.
