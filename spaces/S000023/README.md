Let $X = \{(n,m) : n,m \in \omega\}$ with all singletons
except $\{(0,0)\}$ open.
Define a set containing $(0,0)$ to be open if and only if it contains all but
a finite number of points in all but a finite number of columns.

Defined as counterexample #26 ("Arens-Fort Space")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}.

This space is homeomorphic to a subspace of {S156}.
