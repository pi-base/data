The prime integer topology on the set $X = \mathbb{Z}^+$ of positive integers is generated by the subbasis of all sets of the form $U_p(b) = \{b+np \in X : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for all $p$ prime and $b$ not divisible by $p$.  A base for the topology is given by the collection of all $U_a(b) = \{b+na \in X : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ with $a,b>0$ and with $a$ squarefree and relatively prime to $b$.

Alternatively, a base for the topology is given by $\{U'_a(b) : a,b \in X, \gcd(a,b)=1, b\text{ squarefree}\}$ with $U'_a(b) = \{b+na \in X : n\ge 0\}$.
See {{mathse:4460847}} for a proof of the equivalence.

As a space, $X$ is often called the *Kirch space* (see references in {{wikipedia:Arithmetic_progression_topologies}}).
Defined as counterexample #61 ("Prime Integer Topology")

Compare with {S52}, which has a finer topology.
