The prime integer topology on the set $X = \mathbb{Z}^+$ of positive integers is generated by the subbasis of all sets of the form $U_p(b) = \{b+np \in X : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for all $p$ prime and $b$ not divisible by $p$.  A base for the topology is given by the collection of all $U_a(b) = \{b+na \in X : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ with $a,b>0$ and with $a$ squarefree and relatively prime to $b$.
