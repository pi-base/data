Consider the open cover $\mathcal{O}=\{[0,a)\mid a \in X\}$. If $X$ were weakly Lindelöf, we would find a countable $\mathcal{U}\subseteq \mathcal{O}$ such that $\bigcup \mathcal{U}$ dense. But then $\bigcup\mathcal{U}=X$, since otherwise we would find an $a \in X$ with $[a,\omega_1)\subseteq X \setminus \bigcup\mathcal{U}$. Therefore $X$ would be a countable union of countable sets and thus countable.
