Consider the open cover $\mathcal{O}=\{[0,\alpha)\mid \alpha \in X\}$.
Every countable subset of $\omega_1$ has an upper bound in $\omega_1$.
So if $\mathcal U$ is a countable subcollection of $\mathcal O$, there is some $\alpha\in\omega_1$ such that
$\bigcup\mathcal U\subseteq[0,\alpha]$, which is not dense in $X$.
