Suppose an open neighbourhood $U$ of $\infty$ is orderable. Assume that $(\leftarrow,\infty)_U$ is uncountable. Pick a point $x_0\in(\leftarrow,\infty)_U$. It is isolated, hence it has a successor $x_1$. Applying this argument inductively we construct an increasing sequence $(x_n)_{n=0}^\infty\subset (\leftarrow,\infty)_U$. Note that for each $n<\omega$ the interval $(\leftarrow,x_n]_U$ is finite. Since $(\leftarrow,\infty)_U$ is uncountable, there exists $y\in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty (x_n,\infty)_U$ and the open interval $(y,\rightarrow)_U$ is a not cofinite neighbourhood of $\infty$. A contradiction.
