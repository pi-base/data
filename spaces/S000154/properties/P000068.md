Suppose that $\langle \mathcal{U}_1 , \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots \rangle$ is a sequence of open covers of $X$.

* Pick $U_1 \in \mathcal{U}_1$ containing $p$. Note that $X \setminus U_1$ is finite, so enumerate it as $\{ x_1 , \ldots , x_k \}$.
* For $n = 2, \ldots , k+1$ pick $U_n \in \mathcal{U}_n$ containing $x_{n-1}$.
* For $n > k+1$ pick $U_n \in \mathcal{U}_n$ arbitrarily.

Then clearly $\bigcup_{n} U_n = X$.
