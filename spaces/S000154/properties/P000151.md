In the Rothberger game $\mathsf{G}_1(\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{O}_X)$,
in the first round let Player 2 choose $U_1\in \mathcal{U}_1$ to be any open set containing $\infty$.
The set $X\setminus U_1$ is finite, so in subsequent rounds
let Player 2 choose $U_n$ so that they cover $X\setminus U_1$.
After a finite number of rounds we'll obtain that $\{U_1, ..., U_n\}$ is a cover of $X$.
