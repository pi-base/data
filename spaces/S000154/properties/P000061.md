Note that in any normal space the cozero sets are exactly the open $F_\sigma$-sets (see Corollary 1.5.13 of {{zb:0684.54001}}), hence in $X$ since {S154|P13}.

Suppose that $X$ is cozero complemented and let $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be any countably infinite set. Then $U$ is an open $F_\sigma$-set, so it follows that $U$ is a cozero set. Find a cozero set $V$ disjoint from $U$ such that $U\cup V$ is dense in $X$. Since $X\setminus V$ is infinite we have $\infty\notin V$. Since $V$ is a cozero set, write $V = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty F_n$ where $F_n$ are closed. Then $\infty\notin F_n$ so $F_n$ is finite. It follows that $V$ is countable. But then $X = \overline{U\cup V} = U\cup V\cup \{\infty\}$ is countable, contradiction.
