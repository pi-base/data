    name: Prove that any non decreasing function $f \colon [a, b] \to [a, b]$ must have a fixed point.

Let $f \colon X \to X$ be a continuous map on. One can check that $f$ is non-decreasing, and every non-decreasing function from a closed interval to itself admits a fixed point, e.g., {{mathse:2274413}}.
