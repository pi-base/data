    name: Prove that any nondecreasing function $f \colon [a, b] \to [a, b]$ must have a fixed point.
---

Let $f \colon X \to X$ be a continuous map. One can check that $f$ is non-decreasing ($x<y\implies f(x)\le f(Y)$).
And every non-decreasing function from a closed interval to itself admits a fixed point (see e.g. {{mathse:2274413}}).
