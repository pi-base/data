This space is similar to {S84}, with uncountably many origins.

Given a set $S$ of cardinality $2^\mathfrak c$ with the discrete topology, the space can be constructed as a quotient space of $\mathbb R \times S$ by identifying points $(x,\alpha)$ and $(x,\beta)$ whenever $x\ne 0$.

Equivalently, it can be obtained from $\mathbb R$ by replacing the origin $0$ with many origins $0_\alpha$, one for each $\alpha \in S$.  The subspace $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$ retains its Euclidean topology. Basic open neighborhoods of each origin $0_\alpha$ are of the form $(U\setminus \{0\})\cup \{0_\alpha\}$ with $U$ an open neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb R$.

See {{wikipedia:Non-Hausdorff_manifold}}.

The cardinality $|S|=2^\mathfrak c$ is choosen to illustrate that in {T404} the {P99} hypothesis cannot be weakened to {P2}.
