For each integer $n\ge 1$, let $\mathscr U_n$ be the open cover of $X$ consisting of all open intervals $(a,b)\subseteq\mathbb R$ of length $1/n$ and not containing $0$, together with all the intervals
$((-1/n,1/n)\setminus\{0\})\cup\{0_\alpha\}$ for $\alpha\in S$.
These open covers form a development for $X$.
