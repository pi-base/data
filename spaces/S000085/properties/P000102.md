Let $X=\mathbb{R}\backslash\{0\} \cup \{0_\alpha: \alpha\in A\}$ be a real line with multiple origins. Define a semimetric $d:X^2\to[0,+\infty)$ by
- $d(x,y)=|x-y|$,
- $d(x,0_\alpha)=d(0_\alpha,x)=|x|$,
- $d(0_\alpha,0_\beta)=1$,
- $d(0_\alpha,0_\alpha)=0$,

for any $x,y\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\{0\}$, $\alpha,\beta\in A$, $\alpha\neq\beta$.

Clearly, the sets $B_d(x,\varepsilon):=\{y\in X: d(x,y)<\varepsilon)\}$, for $x\in X$ and $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ are a base of topology on $X$. Since they are also open in the semimetric topology, they form a base of the latter as well.
