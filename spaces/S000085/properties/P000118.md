As $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$ is second countable, take a countable base $\mathcal A$ of open sets for $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$.
Let $\mathcal B$ be the collection of deleted open neighborhoods of $0$ of the form
$B_n=(-1/n,1/n)\setminus\{0\}$ for $n=1,2,\dots$.
And let $\mathcal C=\{\{0_\alpha\}:\alpha\in S\}$, which is a locally finite family of sets.
Since $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ are countable families of sets, they are $\sigma$-locally finite.
So the union $\mathcal N=\mathcal A\cup\mathcal B\cup\mathcal C$ is $\sigma$-locally finite.

Claim: $\mathcal N$ is a $k$-network.
Indeed, consider a compact set $K\subseteq U$ with $U$ open in $X$.
The set of origin points in $K$ is closed in $X$ and discrete, hence compact and discrete;
so the index set $T=\{\alpha\in S:0_\alpha\in K\}$ is finite.

If $T\ne\emptyset$, $U$ is a neighborhood of some $0_\alpha$ with $\alpha\in T$.
So $U$ contains some set $B_n\in\mathcal B$.
The compact set $K'=K\setminus(B_{n+1}\cup\{0_\alpha:\alpha\in T\})\subseteq\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$
is covered by finitely many elements of $\mathcal A$, each contained in $U$.
Together with $B_n\in \mathcal B$ and the singletons $\{0_\alpha\}\in\mathcal C$ for $\alpha\in T$,
this provides a finite $\mathcal N'\subseteq\mathcal N$ with $K\subseteq\bigcup\mathcal N'\subseteq U$.

If $T=\emptyset$, $K$ can be covered by finitely many elements of $\mathcal A$, each contained in $U$.
