Let $P=(\{0,a,b,1\},\le)$ be the four-element poset with $0$ as minimum element, $1$ as maximum element, and the remaining elements $a$ and $b$ incomparable.  This poset is order-isomorphic to the Boolean algebra with four elements.  The space $X$ is $P$ with the corresponding Alexandrov topology, whose open sets are the upper sets for $\le$.

The name "diamond poset" is used for example in {{doi:10.1016/j.jcta.2015.03.010}}.
