Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an almost disjoint family of size $\mathfrak{c}$ on $\mathbb{N}$ (see {{mathse:162387}} and {{wikipedia:Almost_disjoint_sets}}). Every element of $\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set, and so there exists $A\subseteq \lambda$ with $|A| = \mathfrak{c}$ such that $\mathcal{A} = \{S_\xi : \xi \in A\}$. Let $Y = \{x_\xi : \xi \in A\}$. If $\xi\in A$ then $\overline{S_\xi}\subseteq X$ is open and $\overline{S_\xi}\cap Y = \{x_\xi\}$ since $(\overline{S_\xi}\setminus S_\xi)\cap(\overline{S_\eta}\setminus S_\eta) = \emptyset$ for distinct $\xi, \eta\in A$ (here note that necessarily $\overline{S_\xi}\setminus S_\xi\subseteq \beta\omega\setminus \omega$ for $\xi\in A$). So $Y\subseteq X$ is a discrete set of size continuum.
