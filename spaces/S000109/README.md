Defined as $A_1 = N\cup P$ in the proof of theorem 3 in {{zb:0053.12404}}. (<https://eudml.org/doc/213312>)

Let $\{S_\xi : \xi < 2^\mathfrak{c}\}$ be all countably infinite subsets of $\beta\omega$. Find elements $x_\xi$ and $y_\xi$ of $\beta\omega\setminus \omega$ for all $\xi < 2^\mathfrak{c}$ so that the following hold: 

1. All $x_\xi$ and $y_\eta$ are pairwise distinct.

2. All $x\in \beta\omega\setminus \omega$ are either of the form $x_\xi$ or $y_\eta$.

4. $x_\xi, y_\xi\in \overline{S_\xi}\setminus S_\xi$.

Then the Novak space is defined as $X = \omega\cup \{x_\xi : \xi < 2^\mathfrak{c}\}$ with subspace topology.

Constructed as counterexample #112
in {{zb:0386.54001}}. However, the construction in that book is incorrect as it assumes that $2^\mathfrak{c}$ is a regular cardinal, which it consistently isn't.
