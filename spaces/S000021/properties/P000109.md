In Theorem 6a of {{doi:10.1016/S0166-8641(97)00113-2}} it is shown that a topological vector space with its weak topology is metrizable iff monotonically normal. But $X$ is not metrizable as seen in Corollary 28.18 (c) of {{doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-622760-4.X5000-6}}, and so cannot be monotonically normal.
