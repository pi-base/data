Let $(e_k)$ be an orthonormal basis of $H$. For each $n\ge 1$, let $S_n = \{ne_k : k\in \omega\}$.
Parseval's identity $\sum_k \langle e_k, x\rangle^2 = \|x\|^2$ implies that $\langle e_k, x\rangle\to 0$ for each $x\in H$. It follows that each $S_n$ converges to $0$ in $X$.  Any countably infinite set $S\subseteq X$ such that $S_n\cap S\neq\emptyset$ for infinitely many $n$ is necessarily norm-unbounded. Since weakly convergent sequences are weakly bounded, and therefore norm-bounded by the uniform boundedness principle, it follows that such an $S$ does not converge in $X$.  Therefore $X$ is not {P214}.
