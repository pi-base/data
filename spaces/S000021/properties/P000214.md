Let $(e_k)$ be an orthonormal basis of $\ell^2$. Define $S_n = \{ne_k : k\in \omega\}$. 
From Perseval's identity $\sum_k \langle e_k, x\rangle^2 = \|x\|^2$ so that $\langle e_k, x\rangle\to 0$. It follows that $S_n$ converges to $0$ for all $n$. If there existed countably infinite $S\subseteq X$ such that $S_n\cap S\neq\emptyset$ for infinitely many $n$, then $S$ would be norm-unbounded. Since weakly convergent sequences are weakly bounded, and theorefore norm-bounded by the uniform boundedness principle, it follows that $S$ is not convergent.
