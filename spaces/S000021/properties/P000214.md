Let $(e_k)$ be an orthonormal basis of $\ell^2$. Define $S_n = \{ne_k : k\in \omega\}$. 
From Bessel's inequality $\sum_k \langle e_k, x\rangle = \|x\|$ so that $\langle e_k, x\rangle\to 0$. It follows that $S_n$ converges to $0$ for all $n$. If there existed countably infinite $S\subseteq X$ such that $S_n\cap S\neq\emptyset$ for infinitely many $n$, then $S$ would be unbounded. Since weakly convergent sequences are weakly bounded, and so bounded from uniform boundedness principle, it follows that $S$ is not convergent.
