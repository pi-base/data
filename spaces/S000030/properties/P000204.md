If $x\in X$ and $x_1, x_2\in X\setminus\{x\}$, then we can find a $2$-dimensional affine subspace $V\subseteq X$ such that $x, x_1, x_2\in V$. Then $V\setminus \{x\}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{(0, 0)\}$ which is path-connected, so there is a path in $X\setminus \{x\}$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$. It follows that $X\setminus \{x\}$ is path-connected, and so connected, so that $x$ is not a cut point.
