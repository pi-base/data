Any totally-ordered set is clearly this, so we consider when $p$ is one of the points in question.  That is, let $q$ be a point on the long line and $p$ the special point added.  Let $r$ be the least ordinal greater than $q$.  Define the function $f:X\to [0,1]$ as follows for $t\le q$, define $f(q)=0$.  Now note that $[q, r]$ is homeomorphic with $[0,1]$, so for $q \le t \le r$, let $f(t)$ be such a homeomorphism with $f(q)=0$ and $f(r)=1$.  Then define $f(t)=1$ for $t > r$ or $t=p$.
