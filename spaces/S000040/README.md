$X=Y\cup\{\infty\}$,
where $Y=\omega_1\times[0,1)$ with its lexicographic topology is an open copy
of {S38}, and each neighborhood of $\infty$ contains some
$U_\alpha=\{\infty\}\cup\Big(\big(\omega_1\setminus\alpha\big) \times (0,1)\Big)$.

Defined as counterexample #47 ("An Altered Long Line")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
