Suppose, for contradiction, that \(\mathcal{B}\) is a \(\sigma\)-locally finite base for the Altered Long Line. Form a new collection \(\mathcal{B}^\prime\) by replacing every neighborhood \(U_\beta (p)\) with \(U_\beta (p) \setminus \{p\}\). Evidently, the collection (\mathcal{B}^\prime\) is a \(\sigma\)-locally finite base for the Long Line, which [cannot exist][http://topology.jdabbs.com/traits/5996]. Therefore, \(\mathcal{B}\) is not a \(\sigma\)-locally finite base for the Altered Long Line.
