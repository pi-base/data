Consider the set of characteristic functions of all finite subsets of $I$,
i.e. $A=\{f\in X: f(I)\subseteq\{0,1\},\ |f^{-1}(1)|<\aleph_0\}$.
The constant function $\chi_I\equiv 1$ belongs to the closure of $A$, since every base neighbourhood of $\chi_I$
contains an element of $A$.

For any countable $D\subset A$, the union of the supports of all the functions in $D$ is at most countable, therefore
$\chi_I\notin \overline D$.
