Consider the set of characteristic functions of all countable subsets of $I$,
i.e. $A=\{f\in X: f(I)=\{0,1\},\ |f^{-1}(1)|\leq\aleph_0\}$.
The constant function $\chi_I\equiv 1$ belongs to the closure of $A$, since every base neighbourhood of $\chi_I$ contains an element of $A$.

We will show that $A$ is {P20} and {T3}.

Fix $(f_n)_{n<\omega} \subset A$. Denote $L=\bigcup_{n<\omega}f^{-1}_n(1)=\{t_k\}_{k<\omega}\subset I$. We can inductively construct a sequences of elements $z_k\in \{0,1\}$ and $n_k\in\omega$ such that
- $n_{-1}=-1$,
- $|\{n>n_k: f_n(t_j)=z_j\text{ for } j=0,\ldots,k\}|=\aleph_0$,
- $n_k>n_{k-1}$,
- $f_{n_k}(t_j)=z_j$ for $j=0,\ldots,k$.

The pointwise convergence $f_{n_k}\to f$, where $f(t_k)=z_k$ and $f(t)=0$ for $t\in I\setminus L$, is immediate. 

We have proven that $A$ is {P19} but not closed in $X$.
