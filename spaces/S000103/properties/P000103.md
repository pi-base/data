Consider the set of characteristic functions of all countable subsets of $I$,
i.e. $A=\{f\in X: f(I)=\{0,1\},\ |f^{-1}(1)|\leq\aleph_0\}$.
It can be readily verified that $\chi_I\in \overline A\setminus A$, where
$\chi_I\equiv 1$ is the constant function.

We will show that $A$ is {P20} and {T3}.

Fix $(f_n)_{n<\omega} \subset A$. The set $L=\bigcup_{n<\omega}f^{-1}_n(1)\subset I$ is countable. Fix enumeration $L=\{t_k\}_{k<\omega}$. We can inductively construct a sequences of elements $z_k\in \{0,1\}$ and $n_k\in\omega$ such that
- $n_{-1}=-1$,
- $|\{n>n_k: f_n(t_j)=z_j\text{ for } j=0,\ldots,k\}|=\aleph_0$,
- $n_k>n_{k-1}$,
- $f_{n_k}(t_j)=z_j$ for $j=0,\ldots,k$.

Then $f\in X$ defined by $f(t_k)=z_k$ for $k<\omega$ and $f(t)=0$ for $t\in I\setminus L$
belongs to $A$. The pointwise convergence $f_{n_k}\to f$ is immediate. 

We have proven that $A$ is {P19} but not closed in $X$.
