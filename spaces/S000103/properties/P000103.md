The space contains a Cantor cube $C=\{0,1\}^{\aleph_0}$ which is
not {P103}.
<!-- The part below should be removed upon adding
    the "Cantor cube" to the base -->
Indeed, according to Theorem 6.2.16 in {{zb:0684.54001}},
$C$ contains a copy of any compact zero dimensional space of weight $\aleph_0$.
In particular {S36},
since {S36|P50}.
