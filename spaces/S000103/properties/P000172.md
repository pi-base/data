Consider the set of characteristic functions of all finite subsets of $I$,
i.e. $A=\{f\in X: f(I)=\{0,1\},\ |f^{-1}(1)|<\aleph_0\}$.
The constant function $\chi_I\equiv 1$ belongs to the closure of $A$, since every base neighbourhood of $\chi_I$
contains an element of $A$.

Suppose $(f_\alpha)_{\alpha<\lambda}\subset A$ is a transfinite sequence converging to $\chi_I$.
For each $x\in I$ there exists $\alpha_x<\lambda$ such that
$f_\alpha(x)>\frac12$ for all $\alpha\in(\alpha_x,\lambda)$. Since $I$ is uncountable, there exists $x\in I$ such that $L_x=\{y\in I: \alpha_y\leq \alpha_x\}$ is infinite. Then for each of infinitely many $y\in L_x$ and $\alpha>\alpha_x$ we have
$f_\alpha(y)>\frac12$, while $f_\alpha\in A$ has finite support.
