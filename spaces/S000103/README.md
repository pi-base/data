The product topology on $X=I^I$, where $I$ is the {S158}.
In other words it is the set of all functions $f\colon I\to I$, endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.

In general, the *Tychonoff cube of weight* $\kappa$ for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$ is the product space $[0,1]^\kappa$, as defined on page 83 of {{zb:0684.54001}}.
It has topological weight $\kappa$ (see Theorem 2.3.23 in the same reference).
The current space $X$ is the Tychonoff cube of weight $\mathfrak c$.

Defined as counterexample #105 ("$I^I$") in {{zb:0386.54001}}.

Compare with {S32}, which is the Tychonoff cube of weight $\aleph_0$.
