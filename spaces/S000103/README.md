The product topology on $X=I^I$, where $I$ is the {S158}.
In other words it is the set of *all* functions $f\colon I\to I$, endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.

Defined as counterexample #105 ("$I^I$")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}.

The *Tychonoff cube of weight* $\kappa$, that is the product space $I^\kappa$ for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, is defined on page 83 of {{zb:0684.54001}}. The fact that
it actually has topological weight $\kappa$ follows from
Theorem 2.3.23. therein. Obviously $X\cong I^\mathfrak{c}$.
See also {S32}.
