Let $X = \{0,1\}$ with open sets $\{\emptyset, \{0\}, X \}$.
This space may be characterized with the particular point (0) topology on a
two-point set, or the excluded point (1) topology on a two-point set.

Considered as #11 ("Sierpinski Space")
in {{doi:10.1007\/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}.

<!-- [[Proof of Topology]]
The open sets $\emptyset$ and $X$ are included explicitly.

Any union of open sets results in either $\{0\}$ or $X$, which are members of the topology.

Any intersection of open sets results in either $\emptyset$ or $\{0\}$, which are members of the topology. -->
