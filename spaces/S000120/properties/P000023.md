Let $x$ be an endpoint of one of the sets $B_n$.
For an arbitrary neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a large enough integer $m$ and a sequence of points $x_k\in A_k\cap U$ for $k\ge m$ such that $(x_k)_{k\ge m}$ converges in $\mathbb R^3$ to a point on the $y$-axis that does not belong to $X$.
Then that sequence has no accumulation point in $X$, proving that $U$ is not compact.


**Note:** This trait is erroneously asserted to be true in the General Reference Chart for space #123 in
