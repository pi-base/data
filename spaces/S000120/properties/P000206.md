Observe that every point except $(0,n+\frac{1}{2},0)$ (end of some segment $B_k$)
admits a neighbourhood closed in $\mathbb R^3$ (i.e. {P55},
which is hereditary on open subsets).
Therefore Player 1 cannot pick $x_n$ of this form,
because the next move of Player 2 can reduce the game
to the case of a completely metrizable space $V_n$ which is {P206}
(let us call it the "C-scenario").

On the other hand, Player 2 can always make sure that precisely one $B_k$-end lies in
$V_0$, therfore forcing Player 1 to either loose by picking a constant sequence
$\{x_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ or by triggering the C-scenario.
