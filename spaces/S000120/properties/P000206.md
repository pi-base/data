Observe that every point of $X$ not of the form $(0,n+\frac{1}{2},0)$ (endpoint of some segment $B_k$)
admits a neighbourhood in $X$ that is closed in $\mathbb R^3$ (hence {P55}).
Its interior in $X$ is then {P55} as well.

Therefore Player 1 cannot pick $x_n$ of this form,
because the next move of Player 2 would reduce the game
to the case of a completely metrizable space $V_n$, which is {P206}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Completely+metrizable%2B%7EEmpty%2B%7EStrongly+Choquet).
(Let us call this the "C-scenario".)

On the other hand, Player 2 can always make sure that precisely one $B_k$-endpoint lies in
$V_0$, therefore forcing Player 1 to either lose by picking a constant sequence
$\{x_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ or by triggering the C-scenario.
