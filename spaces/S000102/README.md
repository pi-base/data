The Baire metric on $X =\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is defined by $d(\langle x_i\rangle, \langle y_i\rangle) = \frac{1}{i+1}$ where $i$ is the first coordinate such that $x_i \neq y_i$.

This space is homeomorphic to a countable product of discrete spaces of
size continuum.

Defined as counterexample #104 ("Baire Metric on \(\mathbb{R}^\omega\)")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}. Note that therein the index of the first coordinate is $1$.
