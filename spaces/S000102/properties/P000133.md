Consider the lexicographic order on $\mathbb R^\omega$ where the order on each coordinate
has no maximal nor minimal element and provides the discrete topology on $\mathbb R$
(e.g. $x\leq y \iff (x-\lfloor x\rfloor, \lfloor x \rfloor)\leq_{lex}(y-\lfloor y\rfloor, \lfloor y \rfloor)$ ).
Then any interval between the sequences with the same prefix of length $n\geq 2$ is contained in a ball of radius $\frac1{n-1}$
(with arbitrary center inside the interval). For $\{x_i\}\in (\{a_i\},\{b_i\})$ there exist $k,l<\omega$ such that
$a_k<x_k\leq b_k$ and $a_l\leq x_l <b_l$ (in the *discrete* order on $\mathbb R$). Taking $n>\max\{k,l\}$
suffices to ensure that $B(\{x_i\},\frac1n)\subset (\{a_i\},\{b_i\})$. From the above follows that the order topology and the metric topology coincide.
