Consider the lexicographic order on $\mathbb R^\omega$ where the order on each coordinate
has no maximal nor minimal element and provides the discrete topology on $\mathbb R$
(e.g. $x\leq y \iff (x-\lfloor x\rfloor, \lfloor x \rfloor)\leq_{lex}(y-\lfloor y\rfloor, \lfloor y \rfloor)$ ).

Given $\langle x_i\rangle\in (\langle a_i\rangle,\langle b_i\rangle)$ there exist maximal $k,l<\omega$ such that $a_i=x_i$ for $i<k$ and $x_i =b_i$ whenever $i<l$.
Taking $n>\max\{k,l\}$ suffices to ensure that
$B(\langle x_i\rangle,\frac1{n+1})\subset (\langle a_i\rangle,\langle b_i\rangle)$ (elements in the ball agree with $x$ up to coordinate $n$ which guarantees
the desired inequalities with $a$ and $b$).

For a ball $B(\langle x_i\rangle,\frac1n )$ it suffices to change the $n$-th coordinate to its predecessor and successor respectively to find endpoints of an interval contained in $B(\langle x_i\rangle,\frac1n )$.

From the above follows that the order topology and the metric topology coincide.
