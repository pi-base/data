Let $\mathcal{U} = \{U_1(x) : x\in\mathbb{R}\} \cup \{\{y\} : y\in X\setminus \bigcup_{x\in \mathbb{R}} U_1(x)\}$. If $X$ is para-Lindelof, then by taking a locally countable open refinement of $\mathcal{U}$, for every $x\in \mathbb{R}$ there is $n(x)\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\{U_{n(x)}(x): x\in \mathbb{R}\}$ is locally countable. Find $n$ such that $n = n(x)$ for uncountably many $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and let $C = \{y\in\mathbb{R} : n = n(x)\}$. Take a two-sided condensation point $x$ of $C$ (citation needed!) and $m$ such that $U_m(x)$ intersects countably many $U_n(y)$ for $y\in C$. Note that there is $z < x$ such that $U_n(y)\cap U_m(x)\neq \emptyset$ for all $y\in (z, x)\cap C$, and since $(z, x)\cap C$ is uncountable we obtain a contradiction.
