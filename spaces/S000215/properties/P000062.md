The open cover $\mathcal{U} = \{\mathbb{R}\times (-1, 1)\}\cup \{\{x\} : x\in X\setminus (\mathbb{R}\times (-1, 1))\}$ is a partition, and if there is a subfamily $\mathcal{V}\subseteq \mathcal{U}$ such that $\bigcup \mathcal{V}$ is dense, then $\mathcal{V} = \mathcal{U}$. Since $\mathcal{U}$ is uncountable, $X$ is not {P62}.
