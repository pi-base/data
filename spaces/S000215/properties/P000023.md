If $V$ is a compact neighbourhood of $(x, 0)$, then $U_n(x)\subseteq V$ for some $n$. Since $U_n(x)$ is closed, it follows that it must be compact. But since $U_{n+1}(x)\setminus U_n(x)$ is a discrete open set of size $\mathfrak{c}$, the family $\mathcal{U} = \{U_{n+1}(x)\} \cup \{\{y\}: y\in U_n(x)\setminus U_{n+1}(x) \}$ is an open partition of $U_n(x)$ without a finite subcover.
