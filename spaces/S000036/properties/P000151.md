In the first round, after Player I picked some open cover, Player II can then pick a cocountable neighborhood $U$ of the point $\omega_1 \in X$. Choose an enumeration $X\setminus U = \{x_1,x_2,\dots\}$. Player II then has a winning strategy by picking a neighborhood of $x_n$ in the $n+1$-th step of the game.
