Suppose $[0,\Omega]$ were separable, so $D = \{\alpha_n\mid n < \omega\}$ is dense. A countable set of countable ordinals has a supremum $\alpha$ that is also a countable ordinal, so $\alpha < \Omega$ and for all $ n < \omega$, $\alpha_n \le \alpha$. But then the open set $\{\alpha+1\} \subset [0,\Omega]$ misses $D$ and so $D$ cannot be dense. Hence $[0,\Omega]$ is not separable.
