Let $X$ be the set $[-1,1]$ with topology generated by the subbasis of all sets of the form $[-1,b)$ with $b>0$ and $(a,1]$ with $a < 0$. Note that any $(a,b)$ with $a < 0 < b$ is open in $X$ and so this topology is coarser than the Euclidean topology on $[-1,1]$.

Defined as counterexample #53 ("Overlapping Interval Topology")
