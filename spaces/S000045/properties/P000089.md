Let $f:X\to X$ be a continuous function.
Since $x\mapsto -x$ is a homeomorphism, without loss of generality we can asume $f(0)\geq 0$.
If $f(0)=0$ we are done. Otherwise consider $c=f(0)>0$.
Then $0\notin f^{-1}([-1,c))$, hence the open set $f^{-1}([-1,c))$ is empty and consequently $f(X)\subset [0,1]$.
The restriction $f|_{[0,1]}$ is then a continuous self map of $[0,1]$ with the subspace topology,
which is homeomorphic to {S159}.
Then use {S159|P89}.
