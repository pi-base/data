For $t\in[0,1]$ consider its neighbourhood $U_\varepsilon=[-\varepsilon,t+\varepsilon]\cap X$ for $\varepsilon>0$.
$U_\varepsilon$ is covered by union of arbitrary neighbourhoods of its smallest and greatest element, hence
it is comapact (every open cover has at most two-element subcover). Sets $U_\varepsilon$ ($\varepsilon>0$) form a neighbourhood basis for $t$.

Since $t\mapsto -t$ is a homeomorphism, every point has a local base of compact sets.
