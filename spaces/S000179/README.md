---

A certain subgroup of $\mathbb R^{\omega_1}$ generated by a subset $\mathscr L \subset \mathbb R^{\omega_1}$ of cardinality $\omega_1$, viewed as a topological group with coordinate-wise addition and the product topology. This space was constructed with the name $grp(\mathscr L)$ in Section 4 of {{doi:10.1016/j.aim.2017.11.021}} to produce a {P18} topological group ({P87}) whose square is not {P18}.
