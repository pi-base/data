$H$ with the weak topology is a locally convex topological vector
space (see 28.15 of {{doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-622760-4.X5000-6}}), which
means that every point has a neighborhood basis of convex sets.  Any
two points in a convex set are joined by a line segment, which is an
arc that stays within the set.
