Given any two non-empty sets in the Nested Interval Topology one is a subset of the other and the smallest set on the real line is $(0, \frac{1}{2})$ thus all non-empty sets have all points less than $\frac{1}{2}$ therefore the Nested Interval Topology is not $T_0$.

See item #1 for space #52 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}.
