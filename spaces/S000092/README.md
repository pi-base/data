The space $X=\mathrm{DJ}(Y,H,K)$ is the result of applying the double-sided variation of the "Jones machine" to the space $Y=$ {S91} and its two closed subsets $H = L_0$ and $K = \{(0, \frac{1}{n}) : n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ (which have the property that they cannot be separated by open sets in $Y$). It is obtained by taking a two-sided sequence of copies of $Y$, plus two extra limit points, and alternately gluing adjacent copies of $Y$ along either $H$ or $K$.

See description of {S88} for detailed construction.
