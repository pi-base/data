Note that {S97|P51}.
It follows that every non-empty subspace $S$ of {S186}
that is not $\{\infty\}$ contains a non-empty subspace $S\cap(Y\times\{n\})$ of a copy 
$Y\times\{n\}$ of {S97},
which in turn must contain a point $x$ isolated in $S\cap(Y\times\{n\})$.
Since $Y\times\{n\}$ is open, $x$ is isolated in $S$, and the result follows.
