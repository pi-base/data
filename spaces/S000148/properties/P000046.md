Assume there are $a,b\in X$ with $a<b$ such that there is a path from $a$ to $b$. By intermediate value theorem, $(a,b)\subseteq X$.
Now pick an uncountable nowhere dense subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ and consider its image $B$ under a homeomorphism $\mathbb{R}\to (a,b)$.
Then $B$ is uncountable and nowhere dense as well, however $B\cap X=B$, which is uncountable, and thus contradicts $X$ being a Luzin set.
