An uncountable subset of the reals such that its intersection with
every nowhere dense subset of the reals (equivalently,
every meager subset of the reals) is countable.
For background information, see the article {{zb:0389.54004}}, available at the [Topology Proceedings webpage](https://topology.nipissingu.ca/tp/reprints/v01/tp01021s.pdf).

Note that the construction of such a set requires additional axioms beyond $ZFC$.

Here we use the $CH$ construction from Theorem 2.13 of {{doi:10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2}}
in order to guarantee {P150}.
