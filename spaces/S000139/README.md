Let $X=\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ to be the quotient of $\mathbb R$ (with its Euclidean topology) obtained by identifying all the points of $\mathbb Z$ to a single point $\infty$.

Alternatively, this space can be characterized as the *wedge sum*
(see {{wikipedia:Wedge_sum}}) of countably-many circles,
also known as a *bouquet of countably many circles*.

Not to be confused with {S201}, which has a coarser topology.
