Each of the circles (corresponding to an interval $[n,n+1]$, $n\in\mathbb Z$, with the endpoints identified) is a closed subspace of $X$ and {S170|P183}.
And every compact subset of $X$ is contained in the union of a finite number of these circles.

Therefore, taking a countable $k$-network from each of the (countably many) circles and forming their union gives a countable $k$-network for $X$.
