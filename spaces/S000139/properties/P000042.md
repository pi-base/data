A point $x\ne\infty$ has a local base of open neighborhoods, each equal to some arc of a circle around $x$.
And the point $\infty$ has a local base of open neighborhoods of the form $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb Z}U_n$, where each $U_n$ is an open arc around $\infty$ in the n-th circle.
These neighborhoods are all {P37}.
