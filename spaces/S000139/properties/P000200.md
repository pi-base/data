Let one of the circles be denoted by $S^1$. The map $X \to S^1$ which is the identity on $S^1$ and which sends every other point to the mutual intersection point of the circles is a continuous retraction. Since {S170|P200}, it follows by Proposition 1.17 of {{zb:1044.55001}} that $X$ is not simply connected.

See Example 1.25 of {{zb:1044.55001}} for a comparison of $\pi_1(X)$ with the fundamental group of {S201}.
