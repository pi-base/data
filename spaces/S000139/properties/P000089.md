Denote one of the circles by $S^1$ and let $p$ be the mutual intersection point of all the circles.

Construct a continuous map $f$ as the composition of the retraction of $X$ onto $S^1$ sending every point outside of $S^1$ to $p$, followed by a rotation of $S^1$ by a small angle.
The map $f$ has no fixed point.
