Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$. The deleted diameter topology on $X$ is generated by the basis consisting of all open discs with their horizontal diameters except the center deleted.

Defined as counterexample #76 ("Deleted Diameter Topology")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
**Note** that therein the deleted discs are said to form a subbasis while intersection of any two can be obtained as a union
of elements of the basis.
