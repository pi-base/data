Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$. The deleted diameter topology on $X$ is generated by the basis consisting of all open discs with their horizontal diameters except the center deleted.

Defined as counterexample #76 ("Deleted Diameter Topology")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}.
(That reference states that the deleted discs above form a subbasis for the topology, but they in fact form a basis.)
