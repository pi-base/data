The Deleted Diameter Topology on $X$ is finer than the Euclidean Topology on $X$, and as [the Euclidean Topology is not countably compact](http://topology.jdabbs.com/traits/646), the Deleted Diameter Topology is also not countably compact.

See item #4 for space #76 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}.
