Let $X$ consist of the set of points of the plane $R^{2}$ together with an additional point $0^{\ast}$. Neighborhoods of points other than the origin $0$ and the point $0^{\ast}$ are the usual open sets of $R^{2} - 0$; as a basis of neighborhoods of $0$ and $0^{\ast}$, we take $V_{n}(0) = \{(x,y):x^{2} + y^{2} < \frac{1}{n^2}, y > 0\} \cup \{0\}$ and $V_{n}(0^{\ast}) = \{(x,y):x^{2} + y^{2} < \frac{1}{n^2}, y < 0\} \cup \{0^{\ast}\}$.
