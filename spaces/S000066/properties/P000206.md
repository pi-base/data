The space contains precisely two points with neighbourhoods not homeomorphic to {S176}.

Case 1. If player 1 picks $x_n\in\mathbb R^2\setminus\{0\}$, then
player 2 wins the game, since {S176|P206}.

Case 2. If $x_n$ is one of the zero points, player 2 can
choose $V_n$ to exclude the other zero. Then either
$(x_m)_{m\geq n}$ is constant (and player 2 wins) or at some point we have Case 1.
