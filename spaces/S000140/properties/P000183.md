The compact subsets of $X=\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$ are precisely the sets of the form $K$ or $K\cup\{\infty\}$ with $K$ compact in $\mathbb R$ (see {{mathse:4854178}}).

Let $\mathcal{N}$ be a countable $k$-network of $\mathbb{R}$ with the Euclidean topology, for example a countable base for the topology. Then it is easy to check that the countable collection consisting of all the elements of $\mathcal N$ and the singleton $\{\infty\}$ is a $k$-network for $X$.
