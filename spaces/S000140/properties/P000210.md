Fix $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and suppose there is a sequence of sets $S_n$ where for all $n$, $S_n$ converges to $x$. Then clearly for all $n$, $S_n \setminus \{\infty\}$ also converges to $x$.
{S25|P210} and so there is a set $S \subset \left(\bigcup_n S_n\right) \setminus \{\infty\}$ such that $S$ converges to $x$ and $S \cap (S_n \setminus \{\infty\})$ is cofinite for all $n$. Then clearly $S \cap S_n$ is also cofinite for all $n$, and so the desired result is shown for $x$.

Now suppose $A$ is a countably infinite set converging to $\infty$. In particular, $A$ can be enumerated as an injective sequence converging to $\infty$. Let $\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be an injective sequence of points in $X$ converging to $\infty$. Without loss of generality we can assume $x_i$ is never $\infty$ and so $\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is an injective sequence in $\mathbb{R}$.

Suppose $\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ has a convergent subsequence $\{x_{i_j}\}_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$. Then the set $F = \{x_{i_j} : j \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a closed countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and so $X \setminus F = \{\infty\} \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus F)$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$ not containing any points in $F$. Thus $A$ does not converge to $\infty$, since there is a neighborhood of $\{\infty\}$ which misses infinitely many points in $A$.

Now suppose $\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ has no convergent subsequence. Then the set $A$ has a discrete subset of {S25}; call this set $D$. $D$ is a countably infinite closed subset of {S25}, and so $X \setminus D = \{\infty\} \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus D)$ is a neighborhood of $\{\infty\}$ which does not contain $D$ and thus misses infinitely many points in $A$.

Thus there is no countably infinite set $A$ converging to $\infty$, and so the desired result is shown for $\infty$ vacuously.
