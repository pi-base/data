$\{\infty\}$ is a countable intersection of open sets if and only if $X \setminus \{\infty\} = \mathbb{R}$ is a countable union of closed sets. Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a closed set in $X$. As $X \setminus C$ is an open neighborhood of $\{\infty\}$ in $X$, $C$ is countable. As $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, it is not a countable union of closed sets.
