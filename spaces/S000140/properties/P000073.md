The closed subsets of $X$ have one of two forms. The first is $F \cup \{\infty\}$ where $F$ is a closed set in the {S25}. The second is countable closed subsets of {S25}.

Suppose $F \cup \{\infty\}$ is {P39} and $F$ is a closed subset of the {S25}. Then $F$ is an open subset of $F \cup \{\infty\}$ and so is also {P39}.
Since {S25|P73}, this means $F$ is a singleton or empty. But $F$ cannot be a singleton, since then $F \cup \{\infty\}$ is homeomorphic to {S1} and {S1|P39}.
So $F \cup \{\infty\}$ is the singleton $\{\infty\}$.

Meanwhile if $F$ is a nonempty countable closed subset of {S25} which is {P39}, then since {S25|P73}, $F$ is a singleton.

Thus every nonempty irreducible closed subset of $X$ is a singleton.
