Clearly $\infty$ is not a cut point, since $X \setminus \{\infty\}$ is the
space {S25}. So let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and consider a map $f$
from $X \setminus \{x\}$ to {S1}. Then the intervals $(-\infty, x)$ and
$(x, \infty)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ are connected and thus get sent to a
single point. Thus $f$ factors through the quotient space of $X$
where $(-\infty, x)$ and $(x, \infty)$ become points. This space is
{S11} and {S11|P37}; thus $f$ is constant, which proves the assertion.
