The argument is similar to the case of {S78} as detailed in {{mathse:4789562}}.

Let $A=\omega_1\times\omega$.  The point $p=\langle\omega_1,\omega\rangle$ is in the closure of $A$.  Suppose by contradiction that there is a transfinite sequence $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha<\lambda}$ of points of $A$ converging to $p$.  We can assume $\lambda$ is an infinite regular cardinal of smallest possible cardinality.  As $A$ has cardinality $\aleph_1$, $\lambda$ is at most $\omega_1$.  If $\lambda=\omega$, the sequence would be countable and disjoint from some neighborhood $[\alpha,\omega_1]\times [0,\omega]$ of $p$, which is not possible.  So $\lambda=\omega_1$.

But, by considering a suitable nbhd of $p$ we see that for each $n\in\omega$ the $x_\alpha$ are eventually in $\omega_1\times[n+1,\omega)$.  So, if $\pi_2$ is the projection onto the second component, the cardinality of $\{\alpha<\lambda:\pi_2(x_\alpha)\le n\}$ is less than $\lambda$, hence countable.  Since every $\alpha$ is in one of these sets, $\lambda$ can be expressed as a countable union of countable sets, which is impossible.
