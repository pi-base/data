Let $X = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y \geq 0\}$. The topology is defined by letting points of the open upper half plane have their usual neighborhoods and points $(x,0)$ have neighborhoods consisting of open discs in the upper half plane tangent to the $x$-axis at $(x,0)$.

Defined as counterexample #82 ("Niemytzki's Tangent Disc Topology") in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
