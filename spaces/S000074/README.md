Let $X = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y \geq 0\}$. The topology is defined by letting points of the strict upper half plane have their usual Euclidean neighborhoods and points $z=(x,0)$ have as a local neighborhood base the sets of the form $\{z\}\cup D$ with $D$ an open disk in the upper plane tangent to the $x$-axis at $z$.

Defined as counterexample #82 ("Niemytzki's Tangent Disc Topology") in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
