Define a symmetric $d:X^2\to[0,\infty)$ as follows,
where $z,z'$ are distinct points on the real line
and $w,w'$ are distinct points above the real line.

- $d(w,w')$ is the Euclidean distance between the two points;
- $d(z,z')=1$;
- $d(z,w)$ is the radius of the unique circle tangent to the real line at $z$ and containing the point $w$;

and extend by reflexivity and symmetry.
Let $B_d(u,\varepsilon)$ denote the ball with radius $\varepsilon > 0$ and center $u\in X$
with respect to the symmetric $d$.

For $\varepsilon>0$ small enough, the balls $B_d(w,\varepsilon)$ are Euclidean balls around $w$,
which form a neighborhood base at $w$.

And for $0<\varepsilon<1$, the ball $B_d(z,\varepsilon)$ is the union of
$\{z\}$ and the open disk in the upper half-plane tangent to the real line at $z$
and of radius $\varepsilon$.  These balls form a neighborhood base at $z$.
