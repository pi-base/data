A development is obtained by letting $\mathscr U_n$ be
the collection of all open discs of radius $1/n$ contained entirely in $X$
together with all sets of the form $\{z\}\cup D$ with $z$ a point on the $x$-axis
and $D$ an open disk of radius $1/n$ tangent to the $x$-axis at $z$.

See example #6 on page 176 of {{zb:0386.54001}}.
