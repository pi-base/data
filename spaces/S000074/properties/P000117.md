A $\sigma$-locally finite network can be constructed out of a countable basis $\mathcal B$ of $\mathbb R\times(0,+\infty)$ (countable union of families consisting of single sets)
and a family $\mathcal E=\{ \{(x,0)\}: x\in\mathbb R\}$.
Each point admits a neighbourhood intersecting at most one element of any of the families.

Since every open set in $X$ is a union of an open subset of the Euclidean half-plane as some subset of the edge, the family described above is indeed a network.
