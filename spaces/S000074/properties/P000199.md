Consider a map $X\times[0,1]\ni((x,y),t)\to (tx,(1-t)+ty)\in X$.
It is continuous on $(\mathbb R\times(0,+\infty))\times[0,1]$ since the subspace topology is given by the Euclidean metric.
At points from the set $(\mathbb R\times\{0\})\times[0,1]$ the continuity can be readily verified (e.g. by a geometric construction).
