The open subspace $\mathbb R\times(0,+\infty)$ is metrizable, as homeomorphic
to the Euclidean plane.

If we show that $N_1=\{(0,0)\}\cup B_e( (0,1),1)$ is metrizable the proof will be complete,
since all point of the form $(w,0)$ have neighbourhoods homeomorphic to $N_1$.
Define $h:N_1\to (0,1]$ by the formula $h(x,y):=\frac{1-x^2-(y-1)^2}{2y}$
for $y>0$ and $h(0,0):=1$. A~metric on $N_1$ can be defined as
$d(a,b):=\max\{ d_e(a,b), |h(a)-h(b)|\}$.

We have to show that $p_n\to p$ if and only if $d(p_n,p)\to 0$. For $p\neq(0,0)$
it follows from the continuity of $h$ on $B_e( (0,1),1)$. For $p=(0,0)$
one can observe that $\{a\in N_1: |h(a)-1|<\varepsilon\}=N_\varepsilon$ is a neighbourhood
from the standard basis, hence the $d$-convergence implies convergence
in the Niemytzki's topology. Since the latter is stronger than the Euclidean convergence,
the converse implication follows.
