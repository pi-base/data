The open subspace $\mathbb R\times(0,+\infty)$ is metrizable, as homeomorphic
to the Euclidean plane.

For points of the form $z=(w,0)$, the neighbourhoods $\{z\}\cup D$ with $D$ an open disk tangent to the $x$-axis at $z$ are second countable and regular,
hence metrizable by Urysohn's metrization theorem (Theorem 23.1 in {{zb:1052.54001}}).
