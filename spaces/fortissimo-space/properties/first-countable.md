If $\{ U_i : i \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is any family of open neighborhoods of $p$, then $X \setminus U_i$ is countable for all $i$. Then $X \setminus \bigcap_{i \in \mathbb{N}} U_i$ is also countable, meaning that $\bigcap_{i \in \mathbb{N}} U_i$ is uncountable. For any $x \in \bigcap_{i \in \mathbb{N}} U_i$ distinct from $p$ the set $X \setminus \{ x \}$ is an open neighborhood of $p$ which does not have any $U_i$ as a subset.
