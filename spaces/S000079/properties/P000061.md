Suppose $f:X\to[0,1]$ is continuous and $A=f^{-1}((0,1])$.

For each $n<\omega$ there exists $\alpha_n<\omega_1$
such that $f|_{[\alpha_n,\omega_1]}$ is constant (the intersection of
preimages of countably many neighbourhoods of $f(\langle\omega_1,n\rangle)$ has nonempty interior).
Taking $\alpha_\omega=\sup_{n<\omega}\alpha_n$ we know that
on the clopen set $X_1:=(\alpha_\omega,\omega_1]{\times}[0,\omega]\setminus\{\langle\omega_1,\omega\rangle\}$ the function $f$ is constant
on each row. Therefore a cozero set therein equals $(\alpha_\omega,\omega_1]{\times}A_0\cap X$ for some cozero subset $A_0$ of
{S20}. It then admits
an appropriate cozero complement in $X_1$
for {S20|P61}

On the other hand, the clopen subspace $X_0:=X\setminus X_1$ is countable
and {P12} (since {S79|P12}),
and therefore {P61}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=countable%2BCompletely+regular%2B%7ECozero+complemented).

Since $A\cap X_0$ admits a cozero complement in $X_0$ and
$A\cap X_1$ admits a cozero complement in $X_1$, $A$ has a cozero complement in $X$.
