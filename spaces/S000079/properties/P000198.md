$X$ is a countable union of subspaces
$[0,\omega_1]\times\{n\}$ for $n<\omega$ and $[0,\omega_1)\times\{\omega\}$ which are homeomorphic to {S36}
and {S35}, respectively.
Every closed and discrete subset of $X$ has
countable intersection with each of them
({S36|P198}
 and {S35|P198})
and henceforth is countable itself.
