The space contains a dense {P17} subspace, namely the countable union of the horizontal slices $(\omega_1+1)\times\{n\}$, each one of which is compact.

Given an open cover of such a space, each of the compact sets is covered by a finite subcollection of the cover.  The union of all these subcollections is a countable subcollection whose union is dense in the space.
