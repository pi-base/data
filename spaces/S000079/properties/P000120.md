$X$ can be covered by the open and orderable subsets of the form
- $[0,\omega_1]{\times}\{n\}$ for $n<\omega$, 
- $[0,\alpha]{\times}[0,\omega]=[0,\alpha+1){\times}[0,\omega]$
for $\alpha<\omega_1$.

The first ones are homeomorphic to {S36},
and the latter are compact Hausdorff and countable,
therefore {P133} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=countable%2BT_2%2Bcompact%2B%7ELOTS).
