For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, note we can write $L_n \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ as countable union of a collection $C_n$ of disjoint "closed intervals", which are closed in $X$.
$(\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}$ is closed in $X$, as $\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\} = X \cap [\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}$.

Therefore $\{\{0\}, (\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}\} \cup \{\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}C_n\}$ is a countable cover of $X$ consisting of disjoint closed subsets.
