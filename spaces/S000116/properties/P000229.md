Let $L_n \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the closed line segment from $\langle 0, 0\rangle$ to $\langle 1, \frac{1}{n + 1}$. The path components of $X$ are $\bigcup_{n \in \omega} L_n$ and $\big((\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}\big)$ with their topologies as subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

$\bigcup_{n \in \omega} L_n$ is seen to be star-convex and therefore {P199} (see {{wikipedia:Star_domain}}). $\big((\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}\big)$ is homeomorphic to {S210} and {S210|P199}.

Thus both path components are {P199}. The result follows since {T583} and {T846}.
