Let $L_n \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the closed line segment from $\langle 0, 0\rangle$ to $\langle 1, \frac{1}{n + 1} \rangle$. The path components of $X$ are $\bigcup_{n \in \omega} L_n$ and $\big((\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}\big)$ with their topologies as subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

$\bigcup_{n \in \omega} L_n$ is star-convex and therefore {P199} (see {{wikipedia:Star_domain}}); $\big((\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}\big)$ is homeomorphic to {S210} and {S210|P199}.
Hence both path components of $X$ are {P229}
