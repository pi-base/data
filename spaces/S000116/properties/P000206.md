If at any point in the game, Player 1 chooses some $x_n \in L_m\setminus \{(0,0)\}$ and open neighborhood $U_n$ of $x_n$, Player 2 can choose $V_n = U_n \cap (L_m\setminus \{(0,0)\})\subseteq L_m$. $L_m\subseteq X$ is clearly completely metrizable, so $V_n$ is completely metrizable as well, meaning Player 2 has a winning strategy by {T133} and {T645}.

Thus we may assume Player 1 always chooses $x_n \in \{(0,0)\} \cup \big((\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}\big)$ for all $n \in \omega$.
But then if at some point Player 1 chooses $x_n=(0,0)$, Player 2 can choose a neighborhood of $x_n$ disjoint from $(\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}$. Therefore $x_m=(0,0)$ for all $m \geq n$, meaning $x_m \in \bigcap\{U_n:n<\omega\}$.

Therefore we may assume $x_n \in (\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}$ for all $n \in \omega$, but $(\frac{1}{2},1] \times \{0\}\subseteq X$ is homeomorphic to {S210} and {S210|P206}.
