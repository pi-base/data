We show that for any coprime $a,b \in X$, the is an open cover $\mathscr{U}$, such that $\{U\in\mathscr{U}:x\in U\}=U'_a(b)$ and therefore $\operatorname{st}(a,\mathscr{U})=U'_a(b)$. This proves the assertion as $X$ is countable and (for fixed $a \in X$) $\{U'_a(b): b \in X, gcd(a,b)=1\}$ forms a neighborhood basis of $a$.

For all $b' \neq b$, let $p_{b'}$ be a prime such that $p_{b'}> b$. Then we can choose $\mathscr{U}$ as
$$\{U_a(b)\} \cup \{U_{p_{b'}}(b'): b' \neq b\}.$$
