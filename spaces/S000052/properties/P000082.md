We show that for all coprime $a,b \in X$ the subspace $U_a(b) \subseteq X$ is not regular and thus not metrizable.

Choose some prime $p$ not dividing $a$. Note $p\mathbb{Z}$ is closed in $X$ and therefore $T := p\mathbb{Z} \cap U_a(b)$ is closed in $U_a(b)$.

Pick some arbitrary $d \in U_a(b) \setminus T$. If $U_a(b)$ were regular, we find $c \in X$ such that $d \in U_c(d)\subseteq U_a(b)$ is disjoint from an open neighborhood $O$ of $T$.

Let $$s := \prod_{\substack{q \in \mathbb{P} \\ q \mid a}} q^{\nu_q(c)}.$$ Now let $o \in T$ such that $\frac{c}{s} \mid o$ and $o \equiv d \pmod{s}$.
So we find coprime $r,v \in X$ with $o \in U_v(r)\subseteq O$. In particular $\operatorname{gcd}(c,v)\mid s$, implying that by Chinese remainder theorem $\empty \neq U_c(d)\cap U_v(r) \subseteq U_c(d) \cap O$.
