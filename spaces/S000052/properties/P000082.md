We show that for all coprime $a,b \in X$ the subspace $U_a(b) \subseteq X$ is not regular and thus not metrizable.

Choose some prime $p$ not dividing $a$. Note $p\mathbb{Z}$ is closed in $X$ and therefore $T := p\mathbb{Z} \cap U_a(b)$ is closed in $U_a(b)$.

Pick some arbitrary $d \in U_a(b) \setminus T$. If $U_a(b)$ were regular, we would find $c \in X$ such that $d \in U_c(d)\subseteq U_a(b)$ is disjoint from an open neighborhood $O$ of $T$.

Let $\displaystyle s := \prod_{q \in \mathbb{P},\, q \mid a} q^{\nu_q(c)} $.  Since $\gcd\!\left(p \cdot \frac cs, s\right) = 1$, we can use Chinese remainder theorem to find an $o\in U_a(b)$ such that \[ \begin{cases} o \equiv 0 \pmod {p \cdot \frac cs} \\ o \equiv d \pmod s \end{cases} \] and therefore $o \in p \mathbb Z \cap U_s(d) \subseteq p \mathbb Z \cap U_a(d) = T$.

So there exists $v \in X$ such that $\gcd(o,v) = 1$ and $o \in U_v(o)\subseteq O$. In particular \[ \gcd(c,v) \mid \gcd(os,v) = \gcd(s,v) \mid s \mid o - d, \] implying that $\empty \neq U_c(d)\cap U_v(o) \subseteq U_c(d) \cap O$.
