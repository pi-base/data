We show that the for all coprime $a,b \in X$ the subspace $U'_a(b) \subseteq X$ is not regular and thus not metrizable.

For this note that for any prime $p$, $p\mathbb{Z}$ is closed in X$ and therefore $T := p\mathbb{Z} \cap U'_a(b)$ closed in $U'_a(b)$.
Pick some arbitrary $u \in U'_a(b) \setminus T$. If $U'_a(b)$ were regular, we find $c,d \in X$ such that $u \in U'_c(d)\subseteq U'_a(b)$ is disjoint from an open neighborhood $O$ of $T$.

Now let $o \in T$ such that $c \mid o$. So we find coprime $r,v \in X$ with $o \in U'_v(r)\subseteq O$. In particular $\operatorname{gcd}(c,v)=1$, implying that by chinese remainder theorem $\varnothing \neq U'_c(d)\cap U'_v(r) \subseteq U'_c(d) \cap O$. Contradiction.
