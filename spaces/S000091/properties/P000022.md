Define $f:X\to \mathbb R$ as follows:
$$ f((x,t))=\begin{cases}
n & \text{ if } x=\frac1n \geq t, (n\in\mathbb N)\\ 
0&\text{ otherwise }
\end{cases},\quad (x,t)\in X.$$
Note that in a fixed row or column there are only finitely many points
where the value of $f$ is different than at the limit point, hence the function is contiunous.
It is unbounded, since $f((\frac1n,0))=n$.
