Consider the countable open cover $\mathscr U:=\{ L_i: i\geq 1\}\cup \{X\setminus (\{0\}{\times}(0,1])\}$.
Let $\mathscr V$ be an open refinement of $\mathscr U$. For each $i\geq 1$ there exists
$V_i\in \mathscr V$ such that $V_i$ is cofinite in $L_i$.
The intersection $A=(0,1]\cap\bigcap_{i\geq 1}\pi_1(V_i)$ is non-empty (with $\pi_1$ the projection onto the first coordinate).
For $x\in A$, every neighbourhood of $(x,0)$ intersects infinitely many $V_i$'s,
hence $\mathscr V$ is not locally finite.
