Consider a countable open cover $\mathscr U:=\{ L_i: i\geq 1\}\cup \{X\setminus (\{0\}{\times}[0,1])\}$.
Let $\mathscr V$ be a refinement of $U$. For each $i\geq 1$ there exists
$V_i\in \mathscr V$ such that $V_i$ is cofinite in $L_i$.
The intersection $A=\bigcap_{i\geq 1}\pi_1(V_i)$ is non-empty ($\pi_1$ is the projection onto the first coordinate).
For $x\in A$, every nieghbourhood of $(x,0)$ intersects all $V_i$'s,
hence $\mathscr V$ is not locally finite.
