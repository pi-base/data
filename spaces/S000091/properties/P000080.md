Consider $p\in\overline{A}\setminus A$. This means that $p$ is not isolated,
therefore it is the limit point of an open Fort subspace
$F\in \{L_i: i\geq 1\}\cup\{ X\cap(\{x\}\times[0,1]): x\in(0,1)\}$.
Since $p$ is in the closure, there exist infinitely many points in $F\cap A$.
Any injective sequence in $F\cap A$ is then convergent to $p$.
