Let $X$ be a set of cardinality $\aleph_1$ with a distinguished point $p\in X$.
Every point not equal to $p$ is isolated and the open neighborhoods of $p$ are the cocountable subsets of $X$ containing that point.

This space is the one-point Lindel√∂fication of a discrete space of size $\aleph_1$.

If (CH) $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1$ holds, this space is homeomorphic to {S22}.
Compare also with {S157}.

For a general $X$ with unspecified uncountable cardinality,
see counterexample #25 ("Fortissimo Space") in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
