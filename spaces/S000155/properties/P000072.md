In definition 3.7 of {{doi:10.14712/1213-7243.2015.201}} a set-theoretic statement $\mathcal{A}(\kappa)$  is introduced, and in theorem 3.8 it's shown that $\mathcal{A}(\omega_1)$ holds. In theorem 5.6 it's shown that $\mathcal{A}(\kappa)$ implies that $L(\kappa)$ is robustly Menger, where $L(\kappa)$ is the one-point Lindelofication of discrete space of size $\kappa$. In this case $L(\omega_1)$ is {S155}. From theorem 5.5 it follows that robustly Menger implies 2-Markov Menger, so {S155|P72}.
