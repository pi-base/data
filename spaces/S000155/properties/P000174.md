Consider the ordered set $Y=((\omega_1\times\mathbb Z)\cup\{\infty\},<)$,
where the product $\omega_1\times\mathbb Z$ has the lexicographic order
and the element $\infty$ is larger than all the others.
The space $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$ with its corresponding order topology
(see the proof of Proposition 2 in {{mathse:4833761}}).

$X$ is well-based at the point $\infty$, since the intervals $(\alpha,\infty]$
for $\alpha<\infty$ form a neighborhood base totally ordered by inclusion.
And $X$ is trivially well-based at each of the other (isolated) points.
