The topology is generated by the metric $$\rho((x_n),(y_n))=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}2^{-|n|}d(x_n,y_n)$$ where $d(x_n,y_n)$ is the discrete metric.  A space is topologically complete if every Cauchy sequence converges. Choose an Cauchy sequence in $M$, then, for all $\epsilon < 0$ there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m,n \geq N$ then $\rho((x_n),(x_m))<\epsilon$.  We must show that for a given cauchy sequence the terms are getting arbitrarily close to a limit $(x)$. 

 First we will find this $(x)$; so, we chose any element of the sequence and call it $(x_0)$. Now, let $(x_1)$ be an element of the cauchy sequence which is within $\epsilon_1 < 1$ away from $(x_0)$ which means $(x_0)$ and $(x_1)$ match at the indexed spot $0$ because if it differed then $\rho((x_0),(x_1))$ is at least $1$.  Thus, we build $x$ to match $(x_0)$ in the indexed place $0$.  

Now, choose an element $(x_2)$ of the cauchy sequence within $\epsilon_2 < 1/2$ away from $(x_1)$.  We add to $(x)$ that it matches $(x_1)$ in the indexed places $-1,0,1$.  Similarly $(x_3)$ is the element of the cauchy sequence within $\epsilon_3 < 1/4$ away from $(x_2)$.  Thus, we adjust $(x)$ so that it matches $(x_2)$ in the indexed places $-2,-1,0,1,2$.

We continue the sequence of $(x_n)$ in this manner such that for $(x_k)$, the element $(x_{k+1})$ of the cauchy sequence is within $\epsilon_{k+1} < 1/2^k$, and $(x)$ matches  $(x_k)$ in the indexed places $-k,\dots,-1,0,1,\dots,k$.  

Furthermore, given any arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $\epsilon_N$ such that $\epsilon_N<1/2^{N-1}<\epsilon$.  So, for $N \geq \frac{ln{1}-ln{\epsilon}}{ln{2}}$, then for all $n \geq N$, we know $(x)$ agrees with $(x_n)$ from the $-n$ indexed position to $n$.  Hence $\rho((x),(x_n)) < \epsilon_n<\epsilon$.  Therefore, the cauchy sequence converges to $(x)$.  Thus, $\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ is topologically complete because we have proven that given any cauchy sequence in the topology, the sequence converges.
