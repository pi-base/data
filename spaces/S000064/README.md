If $(X,\tau)$ is the {S176},
we define a new topology for $X$ by declaring open each point in the set
$D = \mathbb Q^2$, and each set of the form $\{x\} \cup (D \cap U)$
where $x \in U \in \tau$.

The topology is finer than that of {S176}.

The construction combines the ideas from
{S60} and {S62}.

Defined as counterexample #72 ("Rational Extension in the Plane")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}.
