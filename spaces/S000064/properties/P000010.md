Let $U$ be a neighbourhood of $p\in X\setminus D$ such that $U\setminus D=\{p\}$ (any base for the topology has to contain such open set).
By definition, there exists Euclidean-open $V$ such that $p\in V$ and $V\cap D\subset U$.
Then $V\subset \mathrm{int}(\overline{V\cap D})\subset \mathrm{int}(\overline{U})$ and is not contained in $U$.
