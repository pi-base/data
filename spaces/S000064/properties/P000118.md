A $k$-network $\mathcal N$ can be constructed as the union of the following countably many locally finite families:
- the family $\{ \{x\}:x\in X\setminus D\}$ of singletons of all points outside $D$, 
- a family $\{B\}$ for each Euclidean ball $B$ in $D$ belonging to a countable base for the standard topology on  $\mathbb Q^2$,
- a family $\{\{q\}\}$ for each $q\in D$.

For a compact set $K$ and an open set $U$ with $K\subseteq U$, cover $K$ by a family of open subsets of $U$ consisting of a set $\{x\}\cup B$ (with $B$ as in the second bullet above) for each $x\in K\setminus D$, and the singleton $\{q\}$ for each $q\in K\cap D$. 
The compact set $K$ is covered by a finite subfamily, so $K \subseteq \bigcup\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq U$
for some finite $\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq \mathcal{N}$ consisting of finitely many $\{x\}$ with $x\in X\setminus D$, finitely many $B$, and finitely many $\{q\}$ with $q\in D.$
