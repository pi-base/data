A $k$-network can be constructed as the union of the following locally finite families:
- $\{ \{x\}:x\in X\setminus D\}$ - the signletons of all points outside $D$, 
- countably many Euclidean balls in $D$ forming a base for the standard topology on $\mathbb Q^2$ (each can be a lone member of a separate family),
- $\{\{q\}\}$ for all $q\in D$.

For a compact set $K\subset U\subset X$ we can consider its open cover where neighbourhoods of $x\in K\setminus D$ consist of $x$ and a ball contained in $\mathbb Q^2\cap U$. The points in $K\cap D$ can be covered by sigletons. We take an open subcover of $K$ and then at most twice as many elements of the network are needed to cover $K$.
