A $k$-network can be constructed as the union of the following countably many locally finite families:
- the family $\{ \{x\}:x\in X\setminus D\}$ of singletons of all points outside $D$, 
- a family $\{B\}$ for each Euclidean ball $B$ in $D$ belonging to a countable base for the standard topology on  $\mathbb Q^2$,
- a family $\{\{q\}\}$ for each $q\in D$.

For a compact set $K\subset U\subset X$ we can consider its open cover where neighbourhoods of $x\in K\setminus D$ consist of $x$ and a ball contained in $D\cap U$. The points in $K\cap D$ can be covered by singletons. We take an open subcover of $K$ and then at most twice as many elements of the network are needed to cover $K$.
