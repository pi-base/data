Consider an open cover consisting of $X\setminus (\mathbb Q\times\{\sqrt 2\})$ and $\{(q,\sqrt 2)\}\cup D$ for $q\in\mathbb Q$.
Suppose there is a refinement $\mathscr V$ of the above cover. For each $q\in\mathbb Q$ there exists Euclidean-open $V_q$ such that $(q,\sqrt 2)\in V_q$ and
$V_q\cap D$ is contained in an element of $\mathscr V$.
Picking a convergent sequence of rationals $q_n \to q$ we
observe that infinitely many $V_{q_n}$'s have to intersect any neighbourhood of $(q,\sqrt{2})$, therefore $\mathscr V$
is not locally finite.
