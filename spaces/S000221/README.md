name: Right "open-ray" topology on $\omega_1$
---

As a set, $X=\omega_1=[0,\omega_1)$ with its usual order.
The open sets for the topology are $X,\emptyset$
and all "open rays" $(\alpha,\rightarrow)=[\alpha+1,\rightarrow)$ for $\alpha\in X$.

Note that the "closed rays" $[\beta,\rightarrow)$ with $\beta$ a limit ordinal are not open sets.

The nonempty proper closed sets are the intervals $[0,\alpha]$ for $\alpha\in X.$

Compare with the finer topology of {S221}.
