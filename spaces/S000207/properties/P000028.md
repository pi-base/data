Each point $\langle \alpha,\omega_1\rangle$ has a local basis of sets of the form $(\beta,\alpha]\times(\gamma,\omega_1]$ for $\beta<\alpha$ and $\gamma<\omega_1$, the assertion follows since $\omega_1$ has uncountable cofinality (see {{wikipedia:Cofinality#Cofinality_of_ordinals_and_other_well-ordered_sets}}).
