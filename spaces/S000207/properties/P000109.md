See section 1.4 of
{{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1981-0630058-4}}.

$X$ is {P2} as its topology is finer than the product topology of two Hausdorff spaces.

For $U$ open in $X$ and $\left<\alpha,\beta\right>\in U$,
define $\mu(\left<\alpha,\beta\right>,U)=\{\left<\alpha,\beta\right>\}$ if $\beta<\omega_1$;
and define $\mu(\left<\alpha,\omega_1\right>,U)$
to be any "rectangle" $(\gamma,\alpha]\times(\delta,\omega_1]$ contained in $U$.
It is easy to check that the function $\mu$ satisfies Definition 2 of {P109}.
