Let $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ be two disjoint zero-sets in $X$.

The subspace $Y:=\omega_1\times\{\omega_1\}\subseteq X$
is homeomorphic to {S35}.
The sets $Z_1\cap Y$ and $Z_2\cap Y$ are disjoint zero-sets of $Y$
and we can write them as $Z_1\cap Y=F_1\times\{\omega_1\}$ and $Z_2\cap Y=F_2\times\{\omega_1\}$
with $F_1, F_2$ disjoint zero-sets in $\omega_1$.
Since every real-valued continuous function on $\omega_1$ is constant on a tail interval $(\alpha,\omega_1)$,
at least one of $F_1,F_2$ is bounded in $\omega_1$;
say, $F_1\subseteq [0,\alpha_0]$ for some $\alpha_0<\omega_1$.

Take a continuous $f:X\to[0,1]$ with $Z_1=f^{-1}(0)$ and $Z_2=f^{-1}(1)$.
Each vertical slice $\{\alpha\}\times[0,\omega_1]\subseteq X$ for $\alpha<\omega_1$
is homeomorphic to {S155}
and every real-valued continuous function on {S155}
is constant in a neighborhood of its non-isolated point.
Since there are only countably many $\alpha\le \alpha_0$,
there is a common $\gamma<\omega_1$ such that
$f$ is constant on each vertical slice of $W:=[0,\alpha_0]\times(\gamma,\omega_1]$.
It follows that $Z_1\cap W=F_1\times(\gamma,\omega_1]$ and $Z_2\cap W=(F_2\cap[0,\alpha_0])\times(\gamma,\omega_1]$.
Note that $W$ is a clopen subset of $X$.

On the other hand, $[0,\alpha_0]$ is an {P190} and hence {P217}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Ordinal+space%2B%7EStrongly+zero-dimensional).
Thus the disjoint zero-sets $F_1$ and $F_2\cap[0,\alpha_0]$ can be separated by a clopen set; that is,
there is a clopen set $U\subseteq[0,\alpha_0]$ containing $F_1$ and disjoint from $F_2\cap[0,\alpha_0]$.
The product $U\times(\gamma,\omega_1]\subseteq W$ is clopen in $W$ and in $X$,
contains $Z_1\cap W$ and is disjoint from $Z_2\cap W$.

And finally, $Z_1\setminus W$ is closed in $X$ and
is contained in $\omega_1\times\omega_1$, hence is also open in $X$.
Consequently, the clopen set $V=(U\times(\gamma,\omega_1])\cup(Z_1\setminus W)\subseteq X$
contains $Z_1$ and is disjoint from $Z_2$.
