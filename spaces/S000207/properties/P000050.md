{S35|P50} and {S36|P50};
hence so is their product $Y$, which has the same underlying set as $X$ but with a coarser topology.
Each point of $X\setminus(\omega_1\times\omega_1)$ has a local base in $Y$ consisting of clopen sets in $Y$,
which also form a local base of clopen sets in $X$. 
And each singleton in $\omega_1\times\omega_1$ is clopen in $X$.
