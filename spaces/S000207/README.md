The product of {S35} with {S36},
modified by declaring points of $\omega_1\times\omega_1$ isolated.
Note that each point $\langle \alpha,\omega_1\rangle$ has a local basis of sets of the form $(\beta,\alpha]\times(\gamma,\omega_1]$ for $\beta<\alpha$ and $\gamma<\omega_1$.

H. J. Cohen provides this example, communicated by Bing, in {{zb:0046.16403}}
(<http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3186w/f290.image>)
to show that {P207}
is strictly stronger than {P88}.
See {{mathse:5004796}} for details in English.
