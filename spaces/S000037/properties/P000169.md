If $\omega_1\in U$, where $U$ is regular open, then $(\alpha, \omega_1]\subseteq U$ for some $\alpha < \omega_1$, implying $\operatorname{int}(\operatorname{cl}((\alpha, \omega_1])) = (\alpha, \omega_1]\cup \{\omega_1'\}\subseteq U$. So there is no regular open neighbourhood of $\omega_1$ missing $\omega_1'$.
