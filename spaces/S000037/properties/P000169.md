If $\omega_1\in U$ where $U$ is regular open, then $(\alpha, \omega_1]\subseteq U$ for some $\alpha < \omega_1$ so that $\text{int}\text{cl}(\alpha, \omega_1] = (\alpha, \omega_1]\cup \{\omega_1'\}\subseteq U$. So there is no regular open neighbourhood of $\omega_1$ missing $\omega_1'$, and so $X$ is not semi-Hausdorff.
