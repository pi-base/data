Assume by contradiction that $X$ is {P115}.
Let $\mathcal{U} = \{\omega_1\cup \{\omega_1\}, \omega_1\cup \{\omega_1'\}\}$ and take a sequence $\mathcal{V}_n$ of open covers of $X$, each refining $\mathcal{U}$, such that for each $x\in X$ there exists $n$ with $\text{ord}(x, \mathcal{V}_n) = 1$.
For each $n$, $\mathcal V_n$ contains a neighborhood of $\omega_1$ and a neighborhood of $\omega'_1$, necessarily distinct; therefore, for some $\alpha_n<\omega_1$ the interval $(\alpha_n,\omega_1)$ is contained in two different members of $\mathcal V_n$.
Let $x = \sup_n \alpha_n + 1 < \omega_1$.
Then $\text{ord}(x, \mathcal{V}_n)\geq 2$ for all $n$, contradiction.
