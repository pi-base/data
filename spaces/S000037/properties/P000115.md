Assume by contradiction that $X$ is subparacompact. Let $\mathcal{U} = \{\omega_1\cup \{\omega_1\}, \omega_1\cup \{\omega_1'\}\}$ and take a sequence $\mathcal{V}_n$ of open covers of $\mathcal{U}$ such that for each $x\in X$ there exists $n$ with $\text{ord}(x, \mathcal{V}_n) = 1$. For each $n$ there exists $\alpha_n < \omega_1$ such that $(\alpha_n, \omega_1]$ and $(\alpha_n, \omega_1)\cup \{\omega_1'\}$ are both contained in some element of $\mathcal{V}_n$, and let $x = \sup_n \alpha_n + 1 < \omega_1$. Then $\text{ord}(x, \mathcal{V}_n)\geq 2$ for all $n$, contradiction.
