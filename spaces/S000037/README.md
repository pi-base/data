Let $\omega_1$ be the first uncountable ordinal.  Take $\omega_1+1=[0,\omega_1]$ with its usual order topology and then split the maximum point into two points, similar to the construction of {S65}.  In other words, take $X=[0,\omega_1]\cup\{\omega'_1\}$ where sets of the form $(\beta,\omega_1)\cup\{\omega'_1\}$ with $\beta<\omega_1$ form a neighborhood basis at $\omega'_1$.

See Example 1 in {{mathse:4268177}}.
