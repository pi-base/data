A point $x \in X$ is a countable intersection of open sets if and only if $X \setminus \{x\}$ is a countable union of closed sets. Each closed proper subset of $X$ is finite, and a countable union of finite sets is countable. As $X \setminus \{x\}$ is uncountable, it is not a countable union of closed sets.
