Let $x \in X$. If $(p_n)$ is a sequence in $X$ s.t. whenever $y \neq x$, $y$ appears in $(p_n)$ at most once, then it is easy to check that $p_n \to x$.

Thus, at each round $n < \omega$, Player I can choose $U_n = (X \setminus \{p_0, \cdots, p_{n-1}\}) \cup \{x\}$, which is an open neighborhood of $x$. However Player II responds, it is clear that $(p_n)$ will satisfy the condition that, whenever $y \neq x$, $y$ appears in $(p_n)$ at most once. So, $p_n \to x$ and Player I wins.
