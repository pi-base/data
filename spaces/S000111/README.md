Let $F$ be a non-principal ultrafilter on $\omega$. The space $X$ is the set $\omega\cup\{F\}$ with points of $\omega$ isolated
and neighborhoods of $F$ all sets of the form $U \cup \{F\}$ for $U \in F$.

This is the subspace topology on $\omega\cup\{F\}$ induced as a subset of $\beta\omega$ ({S108}).

Defined as counterexample #114 ("Single Ultrafilter Topology")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.

Not to be confused with {S145}.
