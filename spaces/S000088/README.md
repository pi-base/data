For each ordinal $\alpha$ let $A_\alpha$ denote the linearly ordered set $-0, -1, -2, \dots, \alpha, \dots, 2, 1, 0)$ with the order topology. Let $P = A_{\omega_1} \times A_{\omega}$ and $P^\ast = P \setminus \{(\omega_1, \omega)\}$. We may regard $P^\ast$ as a rectangular lattice with coordinate axes $A_{\omega_1}$ and $A_\omega$.

Form a corkscrew by taking a (countably) infinite stack of copies of $P^\ast$ by slitting each $P^\ast$ immediately below the positive $A_{\omega_1}$ axis and the joining the fourth quadrant of one plane to the first quadrant of the one immediately below it. Complete the space by adjoining a point $a^+$ with neighborhoods all points above a certain level and $a^-$ with neighborhoods all points below a certain level.
