For a space $Y$, define $Z = (Y\times \mathbb{Z}) \cup \{p^-, p^+\}$ where $p^\pm$ are two new points to have topology such that $U\subseteq Z$ is open iff $U\cap (Y\times \mathbb{Z})$ is open in the product topology where $\mathbb{Z}$ is discrete, and if $p^\pm\in U$ then $Y\times \{n\in \mathbb{Z} : (-1)^{\pm 1}n\geq N\}\subseteq U$ for some $N\in\mathbb{N}$. If $H, K\subseteq Y$ are disjoint closed subsets which can't be separated by open sets, define $\text{DJ}(Y, H, K) = Z/\sim$ where $\sim$ is such that $(x, 2n)\sim (x, 2n+1)$ for $x\in H$ and $(x, 2n-1)\sim (x, 2n)$ for $x\in K$. Tychonoff corkscrew is defined as $\text{DJ}(Y, H, K)$ where $X$ is {S79}, $H = \omega_1\times \{\omega\}$ and $K = \{\omega_1\}\times \omega$.
