Clearly the points $p^\pm$ admitt ordered bases.
A point of the form $[\omega_1,k,2n]_\sim=[\omega_1,k,2n-1]_\sim$ has a well-ordered base of neighbourhoods
$(\lambda,\omega_1]\times\{k\}\times\{2n-1,2n\}/_\sim$ for $\almbda<\omega_1$.
Any other point belo gs to a first countable open subspace
$[0,\alpha]\times[0,\omega]\times\{2n,2n+1\}/_\sim$ for some $\alpha<\omega_1$ and $n\in\mathbb Z$
and {T102}.
