Let $q:Z\to X$ be the quotient map.
Clearly the points $p^\pm$ admit ordered bases.
A point of the form $q((\omega_1,k,2n))=q((\omega_1,k,2n-1))$ has a well-ordered base of neighbourhoods
$q((\lambda,\omega_1]\times\{k\}\times\{2n-1,2n\})$ for $\lambda<\omega_1$.
Any other point belongs to a first countable open subspace
$q([0,\alpha]\times[0,\omega]\times\{2n,2n+1\})$ for some $\alpha<\omega_1$, $n\in\mathbb Z$, and we apply {T102}.
