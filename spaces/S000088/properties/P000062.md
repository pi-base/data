space: S000088
property: P000062
value: true
---

The space has a {P17} dense subspace,
i.e. $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb Z}q( [0,\omega_1]\times\omega\times\{n\})$,
where $q:Z\to X$ is the quoitient map.
Given an open cover of such a space, each of the compact sets is covered by a finite subcollection of the cover.
The union of all these subcollections is countable and has a dense union in $X$.
