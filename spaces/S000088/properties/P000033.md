Consider open subspaces $A_n=[0,\omega_1)\times[0,\omega]\times\{2n,2n+1\}/\sim$
and $B_n=[0,\omega_1]\times[0,\omega)\times\{2n,2n-1\}/\sim$ for $n\in\mathbb Z$.
Each of them is {P33}
(for $A_n$ is countably compact similarily as {S35|P19}
and $B_n$ is Hausdorff and {P17})
and each point belongs to at most two such subspaces.
Therefore given a countable open cover $\mathscr U$ of $X$, for each $n\in\mathbb Z$
we can find point-finite open refinements $\mathscr V^A_n$ and $\mathscr V^B_n$
of the covers $\{U\cap A_n:U\in\mathscr U\}$ and $\{U\cap B_n:U\in\mathscr U\}$ respectively. Picking two more open sets covering the limit points, $p^\pm\in U^\pm\in \mathscr U$, we obtain a point-finite refinement
$\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathscr V^A_n\cup \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathscr V^B_n\cup\{U^+,U^-\}$ of $\mathscr U$.
