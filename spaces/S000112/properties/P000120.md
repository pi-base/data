Let $x \in L_1$ and suppose $U$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ that is {P133}. Then $U$ is {P97} by {T463}, let $\varphi \colon U \to \mathbb R$ be the embedding.

Let $V := U \cap L_1$ be the path component of $U$ containing $x$. Then $V \cong$ {S25} and hence $\varphi(V) \cong$ {S25}.

Since $x \in V$, $\varphi(x) \in \varphi(V)$ and thus $\varphi(U)$ is {P41} at $\varphi(x)$.

However $U$ is not {P41} at $x$, and we get a contradiction.
