Let $x \in L_1$ and suppose $U$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ that is {P133}.
Take $V$ some open vertical segment around $x$ within $U \cap L_1$.
$V$ is connected, so $V$ is necessarily order-convex in $(U, \le)$.  Since $x$ is a cut point of $V$, 
there must be points of $V$ on both sides of $x$, i.e., some $a, b \in V$ with $a < x < b$ in $(U, \le)$.
The interval $(a, b)$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ in $U$ and hence in $X$ and is contained in $V$, hence disjoint from $X \setminus L_1$.
But that is impossible since $x$ is in the closure of $X \setminus L_1$.
