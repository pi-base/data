The topology on the space can be generated by the semimetric:

$$d(m,n) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if }m = n\\
\min\{\frac{1}{m+1}, \frac{1}{n+1}\} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Indeed, for any $n \in \omega$, for $\epsilon > 0$ small enough, $B(n, \epsilon)$ is of the form $\{n\} \cup \{m \in \omega: m > N\}$ for sufficiently large $N$, which indeed forms a neighborhood basis at $n$.
