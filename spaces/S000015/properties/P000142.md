An infinite subset $A\subseteq X$ is homeomorphic to $X$ since any bijection $A\to X$ is a homeomorphism. Since {S15|P3}, it follows that the compact Hausdorff subsets of $X$ are the finite subsets, which have the discrete topology. Therefore if $A\subseteq X$ then $A\cap K$ is open in $K$ for all Hausdorff compact $K$. Taking any $A$ which isn't open shows that $X$ is not a $k_3$-space.
