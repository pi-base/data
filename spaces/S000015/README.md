The finite complement topology on a space $X$ is defined by taking
$U \subset X$ to be open if and only if $X \setminus U$ is finite or
$U = \emptyset$. In this case we let \(X=\omega=\{0,1,2,\dots\}\).

<!-- [[Proof of Topology]]
When know that $U = \emptyset$ is open by definition. Now let $U = X$. This implies $X/U = X/X = \emptyset$. Now let $A$ be a collection of open sets in $X$. Let $U = \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i$ where $a_i \in U$ (show that $X/U$ is finite or $\emptyset$). So, $X/U = X /\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i = (X/ a_i) \cap (X/a_{i+1}) \cap \dots$. An arbitrary intersection of finite sets is finite. Now let $A$ be a collection of open sets in $X$. Let $U = \bigcap\limits_i^j a_i$ where $a_i \in A$. So, $X/U = X/\bigcap\limits_i^j a_i = (X/a_i) \cup (X/a_{i+1}) \cup \dots \cup (X/a_j)$. A finite union of finite sets is finite. -->
