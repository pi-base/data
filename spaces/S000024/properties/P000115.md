Consider the open cover $\mathcal{U} = \{X\setminus\{\infty_1\}, X\setminus\{\infty_2\}\}$. Suppose that $\mathcal{V}$ is a $\sigma$-locally finite closed refinement of $\mathcal{U}$. Since infinite closed subsets of $X$ need to contain both $\infty_1$ and $\infty_2$, $\mathcal{V}$ consists of finite subsets of $X$, each of which does not contain both $\infty_1$ and $\infty_2$. Write $\mathcal{V} = \bigcup_n \mathcal{V}_n$ where $\mathcal{V}_n$ are locally finite. The union of those members of $\mathcal{V}_n$ which contain $\infty_1$ is closed, and so is finite. The same is true for the ones which contain $\infty_2$ and the ones which contain neither. It follows that $\bigcup\mathcal{V}_n$ is finite, and so $X = \bigcup_n \bigcup\mathcal{V}_n$ is countable, which is impossible since $X$ is uncountable.
