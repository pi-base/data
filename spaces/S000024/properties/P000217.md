If $Z\subseteq X$ is a zero-set, and $\infty_i\in Z$, then because $\infty_1, \infty_2$ can't be separated by open sets, we must have $\{\infty_1, \infty_2\}\subseteq Z$.
It follows that if $Z_1, Z_2\subseteq X$ are disjoint zero-sets, then $Z_i\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ for some $i$ and so $Z_i$ is clopen in $X$.
