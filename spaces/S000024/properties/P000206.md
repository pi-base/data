If player 1 chooses $x_n\in\mathbb{R}$ at round $n$, let $V_n = \{x_n\}$, and if $x_n\in \{\infty_1, \infty_2\}$ then let $V_n = U_n$.

If $x_m\in \mathbb{R}$ for some $m$, then both players will be forced to choose $U_n = V_n = \{x_m\}$ for $n\geq m$, and so $\bigcap_n U_n = \{x_m\}\neq \emptyset$. On the other hand if $x_n\in \{\infty_1, \infty_2\}$ for all $n$, then $U_n$ are cofinite, so that $\bigcap_n U_n$ is cocountable and so non-empty.
