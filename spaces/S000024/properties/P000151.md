In the Rothberger game $\mathsf{G}_1(\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{O}_X)$, in the first round let player 2 choose $U_1\in \mathcal{U}_1$ to be any open set such that $\infty_1\in U_1$. In the second round let player 2 choose any $U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2$ with $\infty_2\in U_2$. The set $X\setminus (U_1\cup U_2)$ is then finite, so in subsequent rounds let player 2 choose $U_n$ so that they cover $X\setminus (U_1\cup U_2)$. Then after finite amount of rounds we'll obtain that $\{U_1, ..., U_n\}$ is a cover of $X$.
