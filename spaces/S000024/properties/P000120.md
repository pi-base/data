Suppose $\infty_1$ has an open orderable neighbourhood $U$.
It is a cofinite subset of $X$ and every point except $\infty_1$ is isolated,
meaning it has both successor and predecessor in the order on $U$. We can assume $(\leftarrow,\infty_1)_U$ is uncountable.
Therefore we can find a sequence $x_n$ satisfying $x_n < x_{n+1} <\infty_1$ and $(x_n,x_{n+1})_U=\emptyset$. Since $(x_n,\rightarrow)_U$ has to be cofinite, there exist $y\in (\leftarrow,\infty_1)\setminus\{x_n:n\geq 0\}$ such that $x_n\notin (y,\rightarrow)$ for $n\geq 0$, henceforth $(y,\rightarrow)$ is not open.
