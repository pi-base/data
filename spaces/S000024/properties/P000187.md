If $x\in \mathbb{R}$ then player 1 can choose $U_n = \{x\}$; then necessarily $p_n = x$. If $x = \infty_i$ then player 1 can choose $U_n = \{\infty_i\}\cup(X\setminus \{p_1, ..., p_{n-1}\})$. Since any sequence of distinct elements of $X$ converges to $\infty_i$, it follows that $p_n$ converges to $\infty_i$.
