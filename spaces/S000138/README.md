Rudin's Dowker space $X$ is the subset of the product $\prod_{n<\omega}(\omega_{n+1}+1)$ with the box topology
consisting of all functions $f$ such that, for some $i<\omega$, we have
$\omega< \mathrm{cf}(f(n))<\omega_i$ for all $n\in\omega$. By $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)$ we denote the cofinality of $\lambda$ (see {{wikipedia:Cofinality#Cofinality_of_ordinals_and_other_well-ordered_sets}}).

See {{zb:0224.54019}} and section 3.2(i) of {{zb:0554.54005}}.
