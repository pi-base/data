Rudin's Dowker space $X$ is the subset of the product $\prod_{n\in\omega}(\omega_{n+1}+1)$ with the box topology consisting of all functions $f$ such that, for some $i$, we have $\omega< \text{cf}(f(n))<\omega_i$ for all $n\in\omega$.  

See {{doi:10.4064/fm-73-2-179-186}} and section 3.2(i) of {{mr:0776636}}.
