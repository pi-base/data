Rudin's Dowker space $X$ is the subset of the product $\Pi_{n<\omega}(\omega_{n+1}+1)$ with the box topology
consisting of all functions $f$ such that, for some $i<\omega$, we have
$\omega< \mathrm{cf}(f(n))<\omega_i$ for all $n\in\omega$. By $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)$ we denote the smallest ordinal
cofinal with $\lambda$.

See {{zb:0224.54019}} and section 3.2(i) of {{mr:0554.54005}}.
