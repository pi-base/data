Note that there are $\aleph_2$ many $\alpha < \omega_2$ s.t. $\omega < cf(\alpha) < \omega_2$. Thus, $(\omega_1, \alpha, \omega_1, \omega_1, \cdots)$, where $\alpha$ ranges over all $\alpha < \omega_2$ with $\omega < cf(\alpha) < \omega_2$, are in $X$. Hence, $X$ has at least $\aleph_2$ many elements.
