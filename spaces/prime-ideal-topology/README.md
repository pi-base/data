Let $X$ be the set of all prime ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ with basis consisting of all $V_x = \{P \in X : x \notin P\}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

Note that for every $x$, $V_x$ contains all but finitely many $P \in X$ (since each $x$ has finitely many prime factors) and that $0 \in P$ for every $P \in V_x$. 

Any open $U \subset X$ is open if and only if $V = \cup_{x \in M} V_x$. Taking $I$ to be the ideal generated by $M$, a subset $U \subset X$ is open if and only if there is an ideal $I$ such that $U = \{P \in X : I \setminus P \neq \emptyset\}$.
