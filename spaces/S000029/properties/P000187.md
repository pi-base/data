For the compactifying point, note that every neighborhood of this point is dense in $\mathbb Q$. For any strategy of P1, during round $n$, P2 may legally choose some point $x_n\in [0,2^{-n})$. As a result, $\{0\}\cup\{x_n:n<\omega\}$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb Q$ and its complement is a neighborhod of the compactifying point, showing that P2's sequence fails to converge.
