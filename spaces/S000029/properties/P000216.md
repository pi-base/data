Any neighbourhood of $\infty$ is dense in $X$ (see Lemma 2 in {{mathse:5070821}}).
Let $U$ be an open neighbourhood of $\infty$ and assume $U$ is {P30}.
Any open cover $\mathscr U$ of $U$ has a locally finite open refinement $\mathscr V$.
Let $V\in\mathscr V$ contain $\infty$.
Since $V$ is dense in $X$, the cover $\mathscr V$ is necessarily finite,
and therefore $\mathscr U$ has a finite subcover.  That is, $U$ is compact.
Now, {S29|P100}, which implies $U$ is closed in $X$.
Since $U$ is dense in $X$, necessarily $U=X$.
So any other $U$, of the form $X\setminus K$ for some nonempty compact set $K\subseteq\mathbb Q$, is not {P30}.
