  name: Does the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{Q}$ have the fixed point property?
---

Any neighbourhood of $\infty$ is dense (see lemma 2 in {{mathse:5070817}}), and so given open $U\subseteq X$ with $\infty\in U$ and an open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $U$ which is locally finite at $\infty$, the cover $\mathcal{U}$ must be finite. It follows that if $U$ is paracompact, then it is compact. Then since $X$ is {P100} space, $U$ must be closed, and since it is a neighbourhood of $\infty$ and so dense in $X$, we must have $U = X$. And so if $K\subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ is any non-empty compact set then $X\setminus K$ is not {P30}.
