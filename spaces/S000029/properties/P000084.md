Suppose the point $\infty$ has a Hausdorff open neighborhood $U$ and let $x\in U\cap\mathbb Q$. The points $\infty$ and $x$ have disjoint open neighborhoods in $U$, which are also open in $X$. Say $\infty\in X\setminus K$ for some compact $K\subseteq\mathbb Q$ and $x\in V$ with $V\cap(X\setminus K)=\emptyset$. So $x\in V\subseteq K\subseteq\mathbb Q$, showing that $K$ is a compact neighborhood of $x$. That is impossible since $\mathbb Q$ is nowhere locally compact.
