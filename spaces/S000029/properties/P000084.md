Any open neighbourhood of $\infty$ is of the form $X\setminus K$ for a compact $K\subseteq \mathbb{Q}$. If $x\in \mathbb{Q}\setminus K$ and $\infty$ had disjoint open neighbourhoods, say $x\in U\subseteq X\setminus K$ and $\infty\in (X\setminus K_0)\setminus K$ where $K_0\subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ is compact and $U\cap (X\setminus K_0) = \emptyset$, then $U$ would be open in $\mathbb{Q}$ and contained in the compact set $K_0$, and so $U = \emptyset$ since $\mathbb{Q}$ is nowhere locally compact, which is impossible as $x\in U$. So $X\setminus K$ is not Hausdorff.
