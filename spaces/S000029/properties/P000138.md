If $f:\mathbb{Q}\to\mathbb{Q}$ is any homeomorphism of $\mathbb{Q}$, then the map $\tilde{f}:X\to X$ defined by $\tilde{f}\restriction_\mathbb{Q} = f$ and $\tilde{f}(\infty) = \infty$ is a homeomorphism of $X$. By writing $\mathbb{Q} = \bigcup_n Q_n$ where $Q_n$ are open, pairwise disjoint and homeomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$, for example $Q_0 = (-\infty, \sqrt{2})\cap \mathbb{Q}$ and $Q_n = (\sqrt{2}n, \sqrt{2}(n+1))\cap\mathbb{Q}$, and $h_n:\mathbb{Q}\to Q_n$ are some fixed homeomorphisms, we see that any bijection $g:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ induces a homeomorphism $\hat{g}:\mathbb{Q}\to\mathbb{Q}$ by the formula $\hat{g}(x) = h_{g(n)}(h_n^{-1}(x))$ for $x\in Q_n$. Since there are continuum many such bijections (see {{mo:29475}}), there are continuum many homeomorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}$, and so of $X$.
