Let $A\subseteq X$ be non-empty and irreducible. If there existed distinct $x, y\in A\cap \mathbb{Q}$, then $x, y$ have disjoint neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{Q}$ and so in $A$, and this is impossible since $A$ is irreducible. So $A$ can have at most two points so that $A$ is discrete, and because {S1|P39}, $A$ is a singleton, and so $X$ is sober.
