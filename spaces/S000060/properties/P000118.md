Let $\mathscr U$ be a countable base for the topology on $\mathbb Q$.
Then the family $\mathcal N=\{\{x\}:x\in\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q\}
\cup\bigcup_{U\in\mathscr U}\{U\}$ is $\sigma$-locally finite.

Suppose $K\subset X$ is compact and $U\supseteq K$ is open.
For each $x\in K$ there exists $V_x\in\mathscr U$
such that $\{x\}\cup V_x$ is an open subset of $U$.
From the existence of finite subcover of the open cover $\{\{x\}\cup V_x\cap K: x\in K\}$ of $K$ one can deduce
that $K$ can be covered by finitely many elements of $\mathscr U$  and finitely many singletons in $\mathcal N$, all contained in $U$.
