Take any countable partition $\{A_n:n<\omega\}$ of $\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$ into dense subsets.
Then $\mathscr U:=\{A_n\cup\mathbb Q: n<\omega\}$ is
a countable open cover of $X$. Let $\mathscr V$ be an open refinement of $U$.
Let $U$ be any neighbourhood of $x\in\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$. The closure of $U$ contains an
interval around $x$, hence for each $n<\omega$ there exists
$a_n\in A_n\cap \overline{U}$. Since each $a_n$ is contained in a different element of $\mathscr V$,
$U$ intersets infinitely many elements of the cover
proving it is not locally finite.
