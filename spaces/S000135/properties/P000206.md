Observe that there are two cases: either the origin belongs to $U_n$ for every $n< \omega$ and the game is lost for the first player or for some $n$, the origin is not in $U_n$. Then the second player can pick $V_n$ contained in a line passing through the origin.
After that, the game is played on the real line and
{S25|P206}.
