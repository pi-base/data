$X$ is {P36}, for example because {S135|P199}.

For every $p\in X\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ the proper subset
$\{\lambda p: \lambda >1\}$ is clopen in $X\setminus\{p\}$.
In the subspace $X\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ every half-line
starting at the origin is clopen.
Hence for every $p\in X$ the space $X\setminus\{p\}$ is not connected.
