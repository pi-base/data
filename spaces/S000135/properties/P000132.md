Since $X\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ is homeomorphic to the disjoint union of continuum many copies of the real line,
every open set in $X$ missing the origin is $F_\sigma$.
It remains to show that the origin has a basis of open $F_\sigma$ neighborhoods.
Consider $U=\bigcup\{(-\varepsilon_\theta,\varepsilon_\theta)p_\theta: 0\leq \theta< \pi\}$, with $\varepsilon_\theta>0$
and $p_\theta=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$ for each angle $0\leq \theta < \pi$. Then the set
$V:=\bigcup\{[-\varepsilon_\theta,\varepsilon_\theta]p_\theta: 0\leq \theta< \pi\}$ is closed
and $U=\bigcup_{n=2}^\infty (1-1/n)V$.

Therefore every open subset of $X$ can be represented as a union of two $F_\sigma$ sets, so it is $F_\sigma$ as well.
