Take $A\subseteq X$ and $p\in \overline A\setminus A$. If $p\neq(0,0)$ then it admits a countable base of neighbourhoods and picking elements of $A$ from each of those neighbourhoods we obtain the required sequence.
For $p=(0,0)$, there has to exist at least one ray
containing elements of $A$ arbitrarily close to $p$. Otherwise a neighbourhood of the origin disjoint from $A$ could be found.
Hence there exists a sequence in $A$ converging to $p$.
