Take $A\subset X$ and $p\in \overline A$. If $p\neq(0,0)$ then it admits countable base of neighbourhoods and picking elements of $A$ from each of those neighbourhoods we obtain the required sequence.
For $p=(0,0)$, observe that there has to exists at least one ray
containg an element of $A$ arbitrarily close to $p$. Otherwise a neighbourhood of the origin dijsoint with $A$ can be found.
Hence there exists a sequence in $A$ converging to $p$.
