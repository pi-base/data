The radial interval topology on the plane $X=\mathbb{R}^2$ is generated by the basis consisting of open intervals disjoint from the origin on lines passing through the origin, along with sets of the form $\bigcup\{I_\theta : 0 \leq \theta < \pi\}$ where $I_\theta$ is an open interval about the origin on the line with slope $\tan\theta$.
