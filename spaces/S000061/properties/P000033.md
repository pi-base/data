We will use Ishikawa's characterization of {P33}.

Let $q_0, q_1, \dots$ be an enumeration of the rational numbers $\mathbb Q$.
Define $F_n := \{ q_i \mid i > n \}$.
Each $F_n$ is closed in $X$ and the $F_n$ are nested with empty intersection.
Moreover, $F_n$ is dense in $\mathbb R$ with respect to the usual Euclidean topology.

Note that the subspace topology on $D=\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$ coincides with the Euclidean topology induced from $\mathbb R$.
So the subspace $D$ is exactly {S28}.

Now, suppose $U_n$ is an open set containing $F_n$.
The intersection $U_n \cap D$ is open in $D$ and it is easy to check it is dense in $D$.


Since {S28|P64}, $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} (U_n \cap D)\ne\varnothing$,
and hence $\bigcap_{n \in \omega}U_n\ne\varnothing$.
This proves that the space is not {P33}.
