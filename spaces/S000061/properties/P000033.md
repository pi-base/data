Here is a direct proof of this fact:

As stated in the Corollary in {{zb:0066.41001}}, a necessary and sufficient condition for $X$ to be {P33} is that, for any nested sequence of closed sets $F_0 \supseteq F_1 \supseteq \cdots$ such that $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} F_n = \varnothing$, there exist open sets $U_0 \supseteq U_1 \supseteq \cdots$ such that $U_i \supseteq F_i$ for each $i$ and $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} U_n = \varnothing$.

Let $q_0, q_1, \dots$ be a permutation of rational numbers $\mathbb Q$. Define $F_n := \left\{ q_i \mid i > n \right\}$, then $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} F_n = \varnothing$.
Additionally, $F_n$ is closed because the subspace topology of $\mathbb Q$ is {P52}.
Moreover, $F_n$ is dense in $\mathbb R$ with respect to its usual topology.

Now, suppose $U_n$ is an open set that contains $F_n$.
Then, the intersection $U_n \cap (\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q)$ is a dense open subset of $\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q$ when considered with the subspace topology, which coincides with {S28}.

Since {S28|P64}, $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} U_n \cap (\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q) \neq \varnothing$. This implies that {S61} is not {P33}.
