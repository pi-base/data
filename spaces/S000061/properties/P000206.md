We use the fact that the topology induced on $\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q\subseteq X$ coincides with the standard one,
induced by the Euclidean metric.

Player 2 in their first move picks $V_0:= U_0\cap(\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q \cup\{x_0\})$. If
$x_n= x_0\in\mathbb Q$ for each $n\in\omega$, the game is won by Player 2. Otherwise, at some point $V_n\subseteq \mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$
and the assertion follows, since {S28|P206}.
