First we show that $I_n:=[n,n+1]\setminus\mathbb Q$ is relatively compact in $X$.
Fix an open cover $\mathscr U$ of $X$. For each $x\in X$ there exists some $U_x\in \mathscr U$ and $r_x>0$ such that $(x-r_x,x+r_x)\setminus \mathbb Q \subset U_x$. Then $\{ (x-r_x,x+r_x): x\in X\}$ is an open cover of {S25};
therefore there is a finite set $F\subset\mathbb R$ such that
$[n,n+1]\subseteq \bigcup_{x\in F} (x-r_x,x+r_x)$ and therefore
$I_n \subseteq \bigcup_{x\in F}U_x$.

If we fix an enumeration $\{q_n:n\in\mathbb Z\}=\mathbb Q$ and take the family
$\{ I_n\cup\{q_n\}: n\in\mathbb Z\}$, we obtain a countable cover of $X$ by
relatively compact subsets.
