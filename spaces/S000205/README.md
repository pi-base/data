The set $X=\{(x, \sin\frac{1}{x}):x \in (0,1]\} \cup \{(0,y):y \in [-2,1]\} \cup \{(x,-2):x\in[0,1]\} \cup \{(1,y):y \in [-2,\sin 1]\}$ with the subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^2$.

It consists of {S114} together with an extra arc joining its rightmost point to the point $(0,-2)$.

Note: There are a few closely related but non-isomorphic variants of the *Warsaw circle*.
The description chosen here seems to be the most common.
