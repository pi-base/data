For $x,y\in X$, we write $x < y$ if there is a counterclockwise, injective and continuous path from $x$ to $y$. Note that $<$ induces a natural linear order on $X$.


Let $I = \{0\}\times [-1,1] \subseteq X$.
Assume $f:X \to X$ is continuous with no fixed points. Thus we have $(0,1) < f((0,1))$, meaning $x < f(x)$ for all $x \in X$. As $I$ consists of limit points of $X \setminus I$, by continuity this implies $f(I) \subseteq I$. But then $f$ does have a fixed point, as $I$ is homeomorphic to {S158} and {S158|P89}.
