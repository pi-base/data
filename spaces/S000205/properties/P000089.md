For $x,y\in X$, we write $x < y$ if there is a counterclockwise, injective continuous path from $x$ to $y$. Note $<$ induces a natural linear order on $X$.

Let $I = \{0\}\times [-1,1] \subseteq X$.
Assume $f:X \to X$ is continuous with no fixed points, then evidently $f(x) < f(y)$ for all $x<y$ or $f(x)>f(y)$ for all $x < y$.

As $I$ is homoeomorphic to {S158} and {S158|P89}, it suffices to show $f(I) \subseteq I$.
