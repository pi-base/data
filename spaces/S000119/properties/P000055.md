Viewing $X$ as a subspace of $Y=$ {S176},
we have $X=\overline{X}\setminus((0,\infty)\times\{1\})$,
with $\overline X$ a $G_\delta$ set in $Y$
since {S176|P132},
and $(0,\infty)\times\{1\}$ a $\sigma$-compact, hence $F_\sigma$ set in $Y$.
Therefore $X$ is a $G_\delta$ set in $Y$ and the assertion follows
since {S176|P55}.
