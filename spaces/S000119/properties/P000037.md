Assume $\gamma:[0,1]\to X$ is a path joining
$(0,0)$ with $(0,1)$. Denote by $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ projections onto the first and second coordinate, respectively.
There exists a sequence $(t_n)_{n=2}^\infty\subset(0,1]$ such that $t_n\to 0$ and
$\pi_2(\gamma(t_n))=\frac{n+2}{(n+1)^2}$. It can be readily verified that then $\pi_1(\gamma(t_n))\geq n\frac{n^2+n+1}{(n+1)^2}$ proving that $\gamma(t_n)$ does not converge to $(0,0)=\gamma(0)$.
