For each $n=1,2,\dots$, the union of the line segment joining the points $(0,1)$ and $(n, \frac{1}{n+1})$ with the half-line $y = \frac{1}{n+1}$, $x \leq n$ is homeomorphic to {S210} and therefore {P17}, as well as the line $y=0$, which is homeomorphic to {S25}.

Hence, $X$ is a countable union of {P17} spaces and therefore {P17} itself.
