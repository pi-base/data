For each $n=1,2,\dots$, the union the line segment joining the points $(0,1)$ and $(n, \frac{1}{n+1})$ with the half-line $y = \frac{1}{n+1}$, $x \leq n$ is homeomorphic to {S25} and thereofre $\sigma$-compact, as is the line $y=0$.

Hence, $X$ is a countable union of $\sigma$-compact spaces and therefore $\sigma$-compact itself.
