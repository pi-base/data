Let $Y\subseteq X$ with $|Y|=|X|$.
Using well-orderedness and the fact that $\omega_1$ is an initial ordinal,
one can show that there is a unique order isomorphism $f:Y\to X$.
Since $X$ is Alexandrov, so is $Y$ with its subspace topology $\tau_Y$.
The smallest $\tau_Y$-neighborhood of a point $y\in Y$ is
$$(\leftarrow,y]_X\cap Y = (\leftarrow,y]_Y,$$
which coincides with the smallest neighborhood of $y$ in the left ray topology of $Y$.
This shows that $f$ is a homeomorphism.
