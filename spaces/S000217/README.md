Let $X=\omega_1$, with a base for the topology consisting of the left rays
$[0,\alpha]=[0,\alpha+1)$ for $\alpha\in\omega_1$.

The open sets are the downward closed subsets of $X$, which are $X$, $\emptyset$,
the basic open sets above, and the rays $[0,\alpha)$ with $\alpha$ limit ordinal.
This is the Alexandrov topology for the reverse ordering on $\omega_1$.
