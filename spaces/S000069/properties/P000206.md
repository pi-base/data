The proof is analogous to {{mathse:5087450}} for {S68}, using the following fact.

Suppose at the end of round $n-1$ one has $x_{n-1}\in V_{n-1}\subseteq U_{n-1}$ with $V_{n-1}$ a basic neighbourhood of $x_{n-1}$.
If in round $n$ Player 1 chooses $x_n\in U_n\subseteq V_{n-1}$ with $U_n$ a neighbourhood of $x_n$ and $x_n\ne x_{n-1}$, then there exists a closed $x_n$-centred disc contained in the Euclidean interior of $V_{n-1}$.
