Let $\mathscr U$ be an open cover of $X$. Since for each $y\in\mathbb R$ the subspace $\mathbb R\times\{y\}$ is homeomorphic to {S43} and
{S43|P18},
there exist countable subfamilies $\mathscr U_y\subset \mathscr U$ such that
$\mathbb R\times\{y\}\subset \bigcup \mathscr U_y$.
Note that any cover of $\mathbb R\times\{y\}$ consisting of base neighbourhoods in $X$ has an Euclidean-open union (all the deleted radii lie on the line and are assumed to be covered, hence the full discs have the same union).
Hence there exist Euclidean open sets $W_y$ such that
$\mathbb R\times\{y\}\subset W_y\subset \bigcup \mathscr U_y$.
Using the fact that {S176|P18} we pick
countable $A\subset\mathbb R$ such that $\mathbb R^2=\bigcup_{y\in A}W_y$.
Then also $X=\bigcup \bigcup_{y\in A}\mathscr U_y$.
