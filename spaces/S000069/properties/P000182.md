Suppose $\mathcal N$ is a network for $X$.
For every $x\in\mathbb R$ there exists $U_x\in \mathcal N$ such that
$(x,0)\in U_x$ and $V_x:=U_x\cap\mathbb (R{\times}\{0\}) \subset (-\infty,x]{\times}\{0\}$.
Since every $V_x$ has a different supremum of the first coordinate, there are at least continuum many
elements in $\mathcal N$.
