Consider $A\subset X$. There exists a countable set $D_0\subset A$ wchich is dense
in $A$ with the Euclidean subspace topology.
Let $A_0$ be the closure of $D_0$ in $A$ with the deleted radius topology.
If $x\in A\setminus A_0$, then there exists a disc $B_x$ centered at $x$ such that
$B_x\cap A$ is contained in the right radius of $B_x$. The left halfs of such discs
are then disjoint and Euclidean-open, hence $A\setminus A_0$ is at most countable.
Therefore $d:=D_0\cup (A\setminus A_0)$ is a countable and dense subset of $A$.
