Let $Y\subseteq X$ with $|Y|=|X|$.
There is a unique order isomorphism $f:Y\to X$.
Since $X$ is Alexandrov, so is $Y$ with its subspace topology $\tau_Y$.
The smallest $\tau_Y$-neighborhood of a point $y\in Y$ is
$$[y,\to)_X\cap Y = [y,\to)_Y,$$
which coincides with the smallest neighborhood of $y$ in the left ray topology of $Y$.
This shows that $f$ is a homeomorphism.
