For $x \in \{\frac{1}{n}\}_{n \geq 1}^\infty$, $X \setminus \{x\} \cong X$ is connected by {S152|P39} ([Explore](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Hyperconnected+%2B+%7EConnected)).

For $x \in \{0_a,0_b\}$, $X \setminus \{x\} \cong$ is clearly {P196} and thus connected ([Explore](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Hereditarily+Connected+%2B+%7EConnected)).

For $x = -1$, $\{x\}$ is a closed point and the assertion follows from {S152|P39}.
