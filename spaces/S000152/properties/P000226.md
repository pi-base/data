Assume $O_1 \supsetneq O_2 \supsetneq \dots$ is an infinite decreasing sequence of open sets. Since $\{-1,0_a,0_b\}$ is an initial segment of the partial order, we must then have $\{-1,0_a,0_b\} \cap O_n = \emptyset$ for all $n\geq 4$. Therefore $O_n$ must be finite for $n>4$, which leads to a contradiction.
