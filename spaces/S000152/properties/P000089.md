Let $f:X \to X$ be continuous. If for $x,y \in X$ we have $x \leq y$ in the defining peorder, we must have $f(x) \leq f(y)$ since otherwise there would be an open set containing $x$ but not $y$.

Let $A := \{-1, 0_a, 0_b\} \subseteq X$. If $f(A) \subseteq A$, the assertion follows since $A$ is homeomorphic to {S7} and {S7|P89}, in the second case since B is homeomorphic to {S200} and {S200|P89}.

Otherwise we find an $a \in A$ with $f(a) = \frac{1}{n}$. But by above observartion we must then have $f(X \setminus A) \subseteq \{\frac{1}{m}\mid m \leq n\} \subseteq X \setminus A$ and the assertion follows since $X \setminus B$ is infinite but $\{\frac{1}{m}\mid m \leq n\}$ is not.
