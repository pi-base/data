Consider the set $\{1/n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ with its usual order. Let,

$\quad X=\{-1,0_a,0_b\}\cup\{1/n\}_{n=1}^\infty$

where either of the zeros is smaller than all $1/n$, the two zeros are incomparable, and $-1$ is smaller than everything else. Then equip $X$ with the Alexandrov topology associated to the partial order defined above; that is, the open sets are the upper sets for $\le$.

This space is described in part 2 of {{mathse:5007860}}.
