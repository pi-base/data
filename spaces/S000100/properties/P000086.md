The order $\le$ on elements of $X$ is determined by the topology, as it coincides with the specialization order:
$x<y$ iff $x\subseteq\overline{\{y\}}$.

The element $x_1\in X$ with length $l(x_1)=-1$ and range $\{0\}$ has a single immediate successor for that order, namely, the element with length $0$ and range $\{0\}$.
But for example the element $x_2\in X$ with length $-2$ and range $\{0\}$ has two immediate successors, extending $x_2$ to length $-1$ with two possible values.
