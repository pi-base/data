David Gao's example of a nonempty {P40} space that is not {P199},
as constructed in {{mathse:5001004}}.

The underlying set is the set $X$ of partial functions $f$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\{0, 1\}$ satisfying all of the following three conditions:

1. There exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that the domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{Z}_{\leq n}$. We call $n$ the *length* of $f$, which shall be denoted by $l(f)$.
2. There exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(m) = 0$ for all $m \leq n$.
3. Either $\text{range}(f) = \{0\}$ and $l(f) \leq 0$; or there exists $n < 0$ such that $f(n) = 1$, and furthermore if $n_0 = \min\{n < 0: f(n) = 1\}$, then $l(f) \leq -n_0$.

For partial functions $f, g$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\{0, 1\}$, we shall say $g$ is a *truncation* of $f$, denoted by $g \leq f$, if there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $g = f|_{\text{dom}(f) \cap \mathbb{Z}_{\leq n}}$. Truncations of elements of $X$ are also in $X$.
Furthermore, $\leq$ is a partial order on $X$.

To define the topology on $X$, for each $x \in X$, let

$$T_x = \{y \in X: y \leq x\}.$$

And for each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, let

$$K_n = \{y \in X: l(y) \leq n\}.$$

The set $X$ is equipped with the topology generated by the closed subbasis

$$\{T_x: x \in X\} \cup \{K_n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\};$$

that is, the topology on $X$ is generated by the subbasis of open sets consisting of the complements of the $T_x$ and the complements of the $K_n$.
