  name: Why must a continuous function on the Long Line eventually be constant?
---

Let $M:=\left<\omega_1,0\right>$ denote the maximum element of $X$.
Given a continuous function $f:X\to\mathbb R$, there is some $x\in X$ with $x<M$
such that $f$ is constant on $(x,\rightarrow)$
(use the fact that a countable intersection of neighborhoods of $M$
is a neighborhood of $M$).
It follows that a cozero set $U=\text{coz}(f)$ in $X$
is either contained in $(\leftarrow,x)$ for some $x<M$,
or contains $(x,\rightarrow)$ for some $x<M$.

One can then apply the same argument used to show that {S38|P61}.
