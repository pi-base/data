The set $\omega_1$ with topology equal to the join of the cofinite topology and left ray topology in the [lattice of topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_of_topologies) on $\omega_1$. This topology is generated by the sets of the form $\alpha\setminus F=[0,\alpha)\setminus F$ for $\alpha<\omega_1$ and $F\subseteq\omega_1$ finite.
