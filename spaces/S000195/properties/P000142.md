Let $A \subseteq X$ such that for every compact Hausdorff subspace $K \subseteq X$, the set $A \cap K$ is relatively closed in $K$.
If $A$ is finite, then $X \setminus A = \bigcup_{\alpha < \omega_1} [0, \alpha) \setminus A$ is open.
If $A$ is infinite, then being a subset of an ordinal, it is well-ordered, so it has an initial segment order-isomorphic to $\omega$.
Let $U \subseteq A$ be this initial segment, and let $u$ be its supremum in $X$.

Consider an arbitrary $v \in [u, \omega_1)$.
Set $U_v = U \cup \{v\}$. Then $U_v$ with the subspace topology from $X$ is homeomorphic to {S20}.
Then since {S20|P16} and {S20|P3}, the intersection $A \cap U_v$ is closed in $U_v$.
Therefore $v \in A$. Since this works for any $v \in [u, \omega_1)$, we must have $[u, \omega_1) \subseteq A$.

But also $A$ is disjoint from $[0, u) \setminus U$, since $U$ is an initial segment in $A$.
We conclude that $A = U \cup [u, \omega_1)$. Then $X \setminus A = \bigcup_{\alpha < u} [0, \alpha) \setminus U$ is open (since each of the $[0, \alpha) \cap U$ is finite).
