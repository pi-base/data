Consider the open cover $\mathcal{U} = \{ [0, \alpha) : \alpha < \omega_1 \}$. Suppose that $\mathcal{V}$ is a $\sigma$-locally finite closed refinement of $\mathcal{U}$.
Since infinite closed subset of $X$ are unbounded, they are not subordinate to any of the $[0, \alpha) \in \mathcal{U}$, so $\mathcal{V}$ consists of finite subsets of $X$.
Write $\mathcal{V} = \bigcup_n \mathcal{V}_n$, where $\mathcal{V}_n$ are locally finite.

Suppose for sake of contradiction that $S = \bigcup\mathcal{V}_n$ is infinite. Since {S195|P21}, $S$ has a limit point.
Call this limit point $x$, so $x$ is a limit point of $S$. Then $x$ has an open neighborhood $U$ intersecting only finitely many members of $\mathcal{V}_n$.
All the members of $\mathcal{V}_n$ are finite, so $U \cap S$ is also finite. But {S195|P2} means that $U \cap S$ then has no limit points,
so in particular $x$ is not a limit point of $U \cap S$.

Then all the $\bigcup\mathcal{V}_n$ are finite, and so $X = \bigcup_n \bigcup\mathcal{V}_n$ is countable, which is impossible since $X$ is uncountable.
