Let $U$ be a regular open neighborhood of $\omega$, and let $\alpha \ge \omega$. We have that $U$ is cofinite in $[0, \omega)$ (meaning that $[0, \omega) \setminus U$ is finite).

Then let $V$ be a neighborhood of $\alpha$. Then $V$ is also cofinite in $[0, \omega)$.
So $U \cap V$ is cofinite in $[0, \omega)$, and therefore nonempty.
This argument works for any neighborhood $V$, so every neighborhood of $\alpha$ intersects $U$. Therefore, $\alpha \in \operatorname{cl}(U)$.

Since this holds for any $\alpha \ge \omega$, we have that $[\omega, \omega_1) \subseteq \operatorname{cl}(U)$.
Then $X \setminus \operatorname{cl}(U)$ is a finite subset of $[0, \omega)$, so $\operatorname{cl}(U)$ is open.
Then $\operatorname{int}(\operatorname{cl}(U)) = \operatorname{cl}(U)$.
Since $U$ is regular we also have that $\operatorname{int}(\operatorname{cl}(U)) = U$, so in fact $\operatorname{cl}(U) = U$, and $[\omega, \omega_1) \subseteq U$.
So no regular open neighborhood of $U$ misses any $\alpha \in [\omega, \omega_1)$.
