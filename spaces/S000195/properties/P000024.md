Let $U$ be a closed neighborhood of $\omega$, and let $\alpha \ge \omega$. We have that $U$ is cofinite in $[0, \omega)$ (meaning that $[0, \omega) \setminus U$ is finite).

Then let $V$ be a neighborhood of $\alpha$. Then $V$ is also cofinite in $[0, \omega)$.
So $U \cap V$ is cofinite in $[0, \omega)$, and therefore nonempty.
This argument works for any neighborhood $V$, so every neighborhood of $\alpha$ intersects $U$. Since $U$ is closed, $\alpha \in U$.

Since this holds for any $\alpha \ge \omega$, we have that $[\omega, \omega_1) \subseteq U$.
Then $\{ [0, \alpha) : \alpha \in X \}$ is an open cover of $U$ without finite subcover, so $U$ is not compact.
