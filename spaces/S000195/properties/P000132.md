Every closed set is either finite or cocountable. Cocountable sets are $G_\delta$ because they are the countable intersection of complements of singletons. Since a finite union of $G_\delta$ sets is $G_\delta$, it suffices to check that singletons are $G_\delta$.

Let $x \in X$, we need to show that $\{x\}$ is a countable intersection of open sets. For each $y < x$, the set $U_y = [0, x] \setminus \{y\}$ is open. There are only countably many $y < x$, so $\bigcap_{y < x} U_y = \{x\}$ is a $G_\delta$ set.
