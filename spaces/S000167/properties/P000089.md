Continuous maps are monotone on the [specialization preorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialization_(pre)order), which coincides with the underlying order of $\omega + 1 + \omega^\ast$. Since this is a complete lattice, the property then follows from the Tarski fixed point theorem (see {{wikipedia:Knaster–Tarski theorem}}).
