$D$ is a closed discrete subspace of $X$ of size $\mathfrak{c}$. There is $2^\mathfrak{c}$ continuous real-valued functions on $D$ and at most $\mathfrak{c}$ continuous real-valued functions on $X$ since {S216|P26}.

If $X$ were $T_4$ then from Tietze extension theorem we would obtain $2^\mathfrak{c} \leq \mathfrak{c}$, contradiction. So $X$ is not $T_4$.
