The double pointed reals is the product topology on $X = \mathbb{R} \times \{0,1\}$ where $\mathbb{R}$ has the usual topology and $\{0,1\}$ has the indiscrete topology.

<!-- [[Proof of Topology]]
A basis for topology on $\mathbb{R}\times \{0,1\}$ is generated by crossing basic open sets of $\mathbb{R}$ with basic open sets of $\{0,1\}$. The basis for the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the set $\mathscr{R}=\{(a,b) : a,b\in \mathbb{R} \text{ and }a<b\}$, where $(a,b)$ is an interval. So, the basis for topology on the Double Pointed Reals is defined by the set $\mathscr{B}=\{A\times \{0,1\}:A\in \mathscr{R}\}$. More simply, $\mathscr{B}=\{(c,d) : c\in\mathscr{R},d\in\{0,1\}$, where $(c,d)$ is an ordered pair. In a sense, the Double Pointed Reals Topology is like keeping parallel copies of the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$; one mapped to 0 and one mapped to 1.
To prove the set $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $\mathbb{R}\times\{0,1\}$, we must prove
$$\text{ For every } x\in X \text{ there exists some } B_n \text{ such that } x\in B_n$$
$$\text{ If }x\in B_a \cap B_b, \text{ there exists some } B_c \text{ such that } x\in B_c\subset B_a\cap B_b$$
So to prove the first condition, let $x\in \mathbb{R}\times \{0,1\}$. This implies $x$ is of the form $(x,0) \text{ or } (x,1)$. Suppose $x$ is of the form $(x,0)$. Let $A$ be some interval $(a,b)$ that contains $x$. It is obvious that $x$ belongs to the ordered pair $(A,0)$. A similar argument follows for the case when $x$ is of the form $(x,1)$.
To prove the second condition, let $x\in B_1\cap B_2$. This implies $B_1 \text{ and } B_2$ have the same component of the set $\{0,1\}$.  Furthermore, the first element in the ordered pair of $B_1$ and $B_2$ are both of the form $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ respectively such that $x\in (a,b) \text{ and } (c,d)$. Construct a new interval of the form, $(\text{max}(a,c),\text{min}(b,d))$. It follows that $x$ is in this interval, and $x$ is in the basic open set $B_3$ with the first element as $(\text{max}(a,c),\text{min}(b,d))$ and the second element the same as $B_1$ and $B_2$. Both 1 and 2 hold, so the Double Pointed Reals is a basis topology.
