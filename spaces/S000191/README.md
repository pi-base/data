The product space $X=Y\times Z$ 
where $Y=[0,\omega_1]$ is given the topology with points of $[0,\omega_1)$
isolated and neighborhoods of $\omega_1$ cocountable,
and $Z=[0,\omega]$ is given the topology with points of $[0,\omega)$
isolated and neighborhoods of $\omega$ cofinite.

Equivalently, the product of {S155} and {S20}.

The space $X$ has the same underlying set as {S78}, but with a finer topology.

Note that "Dieudonné plank" is also used to refer to {S87}.
