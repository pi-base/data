The space $X=S_\omega$ is obtained from the disjoint union of a countably infinite number of convergent sequences ({S20}) by identifying all the limit points to a single point $\infty$.

So $X=(\omega\times\omega)\cup\{\infty\}$ as sets, with all the points of $\omega\times\omega$ isolated and neighborhoods of $\infty$ being the sets omitting finitely many points from each of the columns of $\omega\times\omega$.
Basic open neighborhoods of $\infty$ are given by the sets
$U_f=\{\infty\}\cup\{(m,n)\in\omega\times\omega:n\ge f(m)\}$
for some arbitrary function $f:\omega\to\omega$.

See also <https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/a-note-on-products-of-sequential-fans> for useful information.

Compare with the coarser topology of {S202}.
