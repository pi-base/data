Each spine $C_m=(\{m\}\times\omega)\cup\{\infty\}$ is a closed subspace of $X$ homeomorphic to a convergent sequence ({S20});
and {S20|P183}.
And every compact subset of $X$ is contained in the union of a finite number of these spines.

Therefore, taking a countable $k$-network from each of the (countably many) spines and forming their union gives a countable $k$-network for $X.$
