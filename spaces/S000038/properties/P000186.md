Let $X_0$ be {S39}. Define $f:X_0\to \prod_{\alpha <\omega_1}\mathbb{R}$ by $f(\alpha, t) = 1_\alpha + t1_{\{\alpha\}}$. 
Then $f$ is a continuous closed injective map, and so an embedding. 
The restriction of $f$ to $X$ is an embedding into $\Sigma_{\alpha < \omega_1}\mathbb{R}$, which is a $W$-group.
