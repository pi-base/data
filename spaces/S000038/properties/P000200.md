For any distinct $p, q \in X$, $[p,q]$ is homeomorphic to {S158}. See item #6 for space #45 in {{zb:0386.54001}}. It follows that $X$ is path connected.

Let $F : S^1 \to X$ be a continuous map. The image of $F$ is compact, hence bounded in $X$ as an ordered set. So $F(X)$ is contained in some interval homeomorphic to {S158}. Since {S158|P199}, $F$ is homotopic to a constant map.
