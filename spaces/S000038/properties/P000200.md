For any two points $p<q$ in $X$ the interval $[p,q]$ is homeomorphic to {S158}.
See item #6 for space #45 in {{zb:0386.54001}}.
It follows that $X$ is {P37}.

Let $F : S^1 \to X$ be a continuous map. The image of $F$ is compact, hence bounded in $X$ as an ordered set. So $F(X)$ is contained in some interval homeomorphic to {S158}. Since {S158|P199}, $F$ is homotopic to a constant map.
