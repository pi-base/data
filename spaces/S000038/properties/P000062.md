If $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathcal{U} = \{[(0, 0), (\alpha, 0)) : \alpha \in \omega_1\}$ is a countable subfamily of the open cover $\mathcal{U}$, then there exists $\alpha < \omega_1$ such that $\bigcup\mathcal{V}$ is contained in the closed set $[(0, 0), (\alpha, 0)]$ for some $\alpha\in \omega_1$, so $\bigcup\mathcal{V}$ is not dense in $X$.
