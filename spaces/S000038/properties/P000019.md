Let $\mathcal{U} = \{U_n\}$ be a countable open cover. If no $U_n$ were unbounded, then $\sup_n (\sup U_n) < (\omega,0)$ and $\mathcal{U}$ would no be a cover. So there is some $U_n$ which covers $((\alpha,0),\rightarrow)$ for some countable ordinal $\alpha$. Since $[(0,0),(\alpha,0)] \cong [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$, the remainder can be covered by finitely many members of $\mathcal{U}$.
