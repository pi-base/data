Every countable set $S\subseteq X$ is bounded in $X$,
and thus is contained in some interval $[p,q]$ with $p<q$ in $X$.
Such an interval is homeomorphic to {S158}, which is {P19}.
Therefore $S$ has an $\omega$-accumulation point in $[p,q]$ and also in $X$.

See item #5 for space #45 in {{zb:0386.54001}}.
