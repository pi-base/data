  name: Why must a continuous function on the Long Line eventually be constant?
---

*Preliminary facts*:
(1) Every left ray $(\leftarrow,x)$ and every right ray $(x,\rightarrow)$ with $x\in X$ is a cozero set.
(2) Every continuous function $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ is eventually constant
(see for example {{mathse:3156975}}).
Hence a cozero set $U=\text{coz}(f)$ is either bounded above,
or contains all elements larger than $x$ for some $x\in X$.

Suppose $U$ is bounded above, say $U\subseteq(\leftarrow,x)$ for some $x\in X$.
The subspace $(\leftarrow,x)$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of $\mathbb R$, hence is cozero complemented.
Take a cozero complement $V$ of $U$ in $(\leftarrow,x)$.
Since $(\leftarrow,x)$ is a cozero set in $X$, $V$ is also a cozero set in $X$.
Let $V_0=V\cup(x,\rightarrow)$.
Then $U$ and $V_0$ are disjoint cozero sets in $X$ and $U\cup V_0$ is dense in $X$.

Otherwise, suppose $U\supseteq(x,\rightarrow)$ for some $x\in X$. Let $U_0 = U\cap(\leftarrow,x)$, which is a cozero set in $(\leftarrow,x)$.
Let $V$ be a cozero complement of $U_0$ in $(\leftarrow,x)$.
Then $U$ and $V$ are disjoint cozero sets in $X$ and $U\cup V$ is dense in $X$.
