In fact, {S146} can be viewed as a subspace of $\omega^\omega$ which $\lim_{n \to + \infty} x_n = \infty$, by Theorem 2.7 of {{zb:0642.54033}} (<https://eudml.org/doc/220890>).

Then using the embedding of $\omega^\omega$ into $\mathbb R$ ({S28}), we know that {S146} can be viewed as a dense subspace of $\mathbb R$, which is {P133}.
