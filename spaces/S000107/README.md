The set $X = \mathbb{R}^\omega$ with the box product topology where basic open
sets are of the form \(\prod_{i<\omega}U_i\) for \(U_i\) open in \(\mathbb R\).
Also known as the Boolean product.

Defined as counterexample #109 ("Box Product Topology on \(\mathbb{R}^\omega\)")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}.

$X$ has a finer topology than {S30}.
