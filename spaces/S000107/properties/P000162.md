The identity function $\text{Id}:\mathbb{R}^\omega\to \mathbb{R}^\omega$, $\text{Id}(x) = x$ from {S107} to $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with product topology is a continuous bijection. Since every subspace of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with product topology is realcompact ($\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is hereditarily Lindelof, and $T_{3.5}$ Lindelof space is realcompact), {S107} is realcompact from corollary 8.18 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}.
