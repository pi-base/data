If Player I, at any point, chooses a point $x_n \in \omega$, then Player II can choose $V_n = \{x_n\}$. This forces $U_m = \{x_n\}$ for all $m > n$ and Player II wins.

Otherwise, Player I starts with $x_0 \in M$ and $U_0$, an open neighborhood of $x_0$. Player II can then choose $V_0 = (\omega \cap U_0) \cup \{x_0\}$, which is easily seen to be an open neighborhood of $x_0$ contained in $U_0$. From this point onwards, if Player I chooses a point in $\omega$, Player II can win, as observed before. Otherwise, Player I must always choose $x_0$, so $x_0 \in \bigcap_{n<\omega} U_n$ and Player II wins as well.
