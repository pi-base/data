For any $n \in \omega$, $\mathcal{N}_n = \{\{n\}\} \cup \{\{F\}: F \in M\}$ is a locally finite family. Indeed, for any $m \in \omega$, $\{m\}$ is an open neighborhood that only intersects at most one element of $\mathcal{N}_n$. And, for any $G \in M$, $\omega \cup \{G\}$ is an open neighborhood that only intersects two elements of $\mathcal{N}_n$. Thus, $\mathcal{N} = \bigcup_{n \in \omega} \mathcal{N}_n = \{\{x\}: x \in X\}$ is a $\sigma$-locally finite family and clearly a network.
