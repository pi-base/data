For any continuous $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$, the definition of the topology ensures that $f(F) = \lim_{n \to F} f(n)$ for every
$F \in M$, so $f$ is actually continuous as a function $\beta\omega \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta\omega$ is
{S108}. Since {S108|P16},
the range of $f$ is compact and thus bounded.
