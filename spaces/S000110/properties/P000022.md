For any continuous $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$, the definition of the topology ensures that if $x_n = n$ then $x_n\to F$ for all $F\in M$, so that $f(x_n)\to f(F)$ for all
$F \in M$, so $f$ is constant on $M$, and so continuous as a function $\beta\omega \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta\omega$ is
{S108}. Since {S108|P22},
$f$ is bounded.
