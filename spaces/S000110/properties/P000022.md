For any continuous $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$, the restriction $f\restriction_{\omega\cup \{F\}}$ is continuous for any $F\in M$. Since the topology on $\omega\cup \{F\}$ as a subspace of $X$ and of $\beta \omega$ coincides, and $\omega$ is dense in $\beta\omega$, it follows from theorem 1.8.5.1 of {{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-61701-0}} that $f$ is continuous as a function $f:\beta\omega\to \mathbb{R}$. Since {S108|P22}, $f$ is bounded.
