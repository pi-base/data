Let $\{U_k\}_{k \in \omega}$ be a countable open cover of $X$. Since all subsets of $M$ are closed, we may first refine $\{U_k\}_{k \in \omega}$ to an open cover $\{V_k\}_{k \in \omega}$ where $M \cap V_k$ are pairwise disjoint. Then choose the further refinement $\mathscr{W} = \{\{n\}: n \in \omega\} \cup \{V_k \setminus \{0, \cdots, k\}: k \in \omega\}$. This refinement is point-finite. Indeed, for any $F \in M$, as $M \cap V_k$ are pairwise disjoint, $F$ belongs to exactly one $V_k$ so $F$ is contained in exactly one element of $\mathscr{W}$. For $n \in \omega$, it at most belongs to $\{n\}, V_0 \setminus \{0\}, \cdots, V_{n-1} \setminus \{0, \cdots, n-1\}$ and it cannot belong to any other element of $\mathscr{W}$. So, $\mathscr{W}$ is point-finite at $n$ as well.
