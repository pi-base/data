Given any free ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\mathbb{N}$, since $\mathbb{N}$ is realcompact there exist $A_n\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} A_n = \emptyset$. Then $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} (A_n\cup \{\mathcal{U}}) = \{\mathcal{U}\}$ is a countable intersection of open sets, but is not open.
