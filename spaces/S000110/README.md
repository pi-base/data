Let $M$ be the set of all free ultrafilters on $\omega$. The strong ultrafilter
topology is the set $X = \omega \cup M$ with topology generated by singletons
of $\omega$ along with all sets of the form $A \cup \{F\}$ for $A \in F \in M$.

Defined as counterexample #113 ("Strong Ultrafilter Topology")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
