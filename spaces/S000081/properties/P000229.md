The subspace topology on $[0, \omega_1) \times [-1, 1] \subseteq X$ is the standard product topology. The subspace topology on $\{\omega_1\} \times [-1, 1] \subseteq X$ is a (topological) disjoint union of $\{\omega_1\} \times [-1, 0)$ and $\{\omega_1\} \times [0, 1]$ with their standard topologies. $X$ has a finer topology than $[0, \omega_1] \times [-1, 1]$ with the product topology.

It follows that the path components of $X$ are $\{\omega_1\} \times [-1, 0)$, $\{\omega_1\} \times [0, 1]$, and $\{\alpha\} \times [-1, 1]$ for each $\alpha < \omega_1$, all with their standard topologies. Thus each path component is homeomorphic to {S210} or {S158}.

The result follows since {S210|P229} and {S158|P229}.
