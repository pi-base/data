The topology of $[0, \omega_1) \times [-1, 1] \subset X$ is the standard product topology. The topology of $\{\omega_1\} \times [-1, 1] \subset X$ is a (topological) disjoint union of $\{\omega_1\} \times [-1, 0)$, $\{\omega_1\} \times \{0\}$, and $\{\omega_1\} \times (0, 1]$ with their standard topologies. $X$ has a finer topology than $[0, \omega_1] \times [-1, 1]$ with the product topology.

It follows that the path components of $X$ are $\{\omega_1\} \times [-1, 0)$, $\{\omega_1\} \times \{0\}$, $\{\omega_1\} \times (0, 1]$, and $\{\alpha\} \times [-1, 1]$ for each $\alpha < \omega_1$, all with their standard topologies. Thus each path component is homeomorphic to {S210}, {S162}, or {S159}.

The result follows since {S210|P229}, {S162|P229}, and {S158|P229}.
