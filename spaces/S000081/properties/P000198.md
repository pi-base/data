$X$ is the union of finitely many subspaces, each with {P198}:
* $[0, \omega_1] \times [-1, 0)$, because it is {P18} as the product of a {P16} space and a {P18} space, and {T562}.
* $[0, \omega_1] \times (0, 1]$ for the same reason.
* $[0, \omega_1) \times \{0\}$, because it is homeomorphic to {S35} and {S35|P198}.
* $\{\left< \omega_1, 0 \right>\}$, because {S162|P198}.
