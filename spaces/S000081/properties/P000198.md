$X$ is the union of $[0, \omega_1] \times [-1, 0)$, $[0, \omega_1] \times (0, 1]$, $[0, \omega_1) \times \{0\}$ and $\left\{ \left< \omega_1, 0 \right> \right\}$.
All of them are {P198}:
* The first two space is a product of a {P16} space and {P18} space. So it is {P18} and {T562}.
* $[0, \omega_1) \times \{0\}$ is homeomorphic to {S35} and {S35|P198}.
* The last space is {S162} and {S162|P198}.
