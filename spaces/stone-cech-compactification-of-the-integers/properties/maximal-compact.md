[[Proof]]

* [T000410] [Compact|P000016]
* [T000411] [Extremally Disconnected|P000049]
* [I000231] ([Compact|P000016] + [KC|P000100]) => [maximal compact|P000102]
* [I000228] [$T_2$|P000003] => [KC|P000100]
* [I000032] [$T_{2 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000004] => [$T_2$|P000003]
* [I000086] [Urysohn|P000009] => [$T_{2 \frac{1}{2}}$|P000004]
* [I000048] [Totally Separated|P000048] => [Urysohn|P000009]
* [I000045] [Extremally Disconnected|P000049] => [Totally Separated|P000048]
