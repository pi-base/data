    name: Show that the product topology on $X\times Y$ is the same as the disjoint union topology on $\bigsqcup_{y\in Y}X$.

Let $D$ denote {S3} and $\mathbb Q$ denote {S27}. By {{mathse:2726886}}, 
$$X = \bigsqcup_{d \in D} \mathbb{Q} \cong D \times \mathbb{Q}.$$
Since {S3|P87} and {S27|P87}, and a product of topological groups is a topological group, it follows that $X$ {P87}.
