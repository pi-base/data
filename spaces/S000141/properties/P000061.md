The set $U=\omega^*$ is a cozero set, as a countable set of closed isolated points of $X$.
Suppose $V=\text{coz}(g)$, with $g:X\to\mathbb R$, is a cozero set disjoint from $U$.
Since the point $p$ (between $\omega_1$ and $\omega^*$) is in $\overline U$,
necessarily $g(p)=0$.
Hence, by the properties of $\omega_1+1$, $g$ has constant value $0$ on a whole interval $[x,p]$
for some $x<p$.  So we must have $V\subseteq[0,x)$ and therefore $U\cup V$ is not dense in $X$.
