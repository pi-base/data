Every element $x\in\omega^*$ has an immediate predecessor and an immediate successor in the order of $X$.
So the singleton $\{x\}$ is a clopen set in $X$, and hence a cozero set.
Thus the set $U=\omega^*$ is a cozero set in $X$, as a countable union of cozero sets.

Suppose $V=\text{coz}(g)$, with $g:X\to\mathbb R$, is a cozero set disjoint from $U$.
Since the point $p$ (between $\omega_1$ and $\omega^*$) is in $\overline U\setminus U$,
necessarily $g(p)=0$.
On the other hand, a continuous function $h:\omega_1+1\to\mathbb R$ with
$h(\omega_1)=r\in\mathbb R$ has constant value $r$
on an interval $[x,\omega_1]\subseteq\omega_1+1$ for some $x<\omega_1$.
Indeed, $f^{-1}(r)=\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N}f^{-1}((r-\frac1n,r+\frac1n))$ is a countable
intersection of neighborhoods of $\omega_1$, which is also a neighborhood of $\omega_1$.
It follows that the function $g$ has value $0$ on an open interval $(x,p)$ of $X$ for some $x<p$
and therefore $U\cup V$ is not dense in $X$.
