Let $H = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R} : y>0\}$ be the upper half plane and $L$ the $x$-axis. The half disc topology on $X = H \cup L$ is the topology generated by the following neighborhood bases: points $x\in H$ have the usual Euclidean neighborhoods and points $x \in L$ have neighborhoods of the form $\{x\} \cup (H \cap U)$ where $x \in U$ and $U$ is open in the usual Euclidean topology.
