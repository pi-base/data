If $x, y$ are two distinct points of $X$, then either one of them is of the form $a_{\alpha\beta}$ so the clopen set $U = \{a_{\alpha\beta}\}$ separates them, or none of them is of the form $a_{\alpha\beta}$, but one is of the form $c_{\gamma}$ so that the clopen set $U = \{c_{\gamma}\}\cup\{a_{\gamma\beta}:\beta < \omega_1\}$ separates them.
