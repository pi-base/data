name: Right "closed-ray" topology on $\omega_1$
---

As a set, $X=\omega_1=[0,\omega_1)$ with its usual order.
The open sets are the [upward-closed sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_set) in the ordered set $(X,\le)$,
consisting of $\emptyset$ and the "closed rays" $[\alpha,\rightarrow)$ for $\alpha\in X$.

- The open sets include the "open rays" since $(\beta,\rightarrow)=[\beta+1,\rightarrow)$.
- The topology is the {P90} topology corresponding to $(X,\le)$.

The closed sets are the downward-closed sets in $(X,\le)$.

Compare with the coarser topology of {S221}.
