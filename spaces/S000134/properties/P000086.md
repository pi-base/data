Removing the origin partitions the space into continuum many connected components (the open rays emanating from the origin), whereas removing any point $p$ other than the origin partitions the space into two connected components (the open ray emanating from $p$
 away from the origin, and the rest of the space). Thus the origin is not moved by any self-homeomorphism of the space.
