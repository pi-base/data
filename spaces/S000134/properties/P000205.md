The space is {P36}.

In the radial metric every open half-ray starting at the origin is open, hence their disjoint union, $\mathbb R^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}$, is not {P36}.

For any $p\in \mathbb R^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ the set
$R_p=\{\lambda p: \lambda >1\}$ is open
and $R_p\cup\{p\}=\{\lambda p: \lambda \geq 1\}$ is closed. Therefore $\mathbb R^2\setminus\{p\}$ is not {P36} in the radial metric topology.
