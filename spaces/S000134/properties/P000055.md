The metric $r$ is complete.
Every line passing through the origin is isometric to {S25},
hence a Cauchy sequence eventually contained in such a line has a limit by completeness
of the Euclidean metric.

Assume $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence not contained in a line, i.e. for
every $n$ there exists $n'>n$ such that $x_n$ and $x_{n'}$ are not colinear with $\vec 0$.
Then $r(x_n,x_{n'}) = d_e(x_n,\vec 0)+d_e(x_{n'},\vec 0)\geq r(x_n,\vec 0)$. The assumption $r(x_n,x_m)\to 0$ (for $n,m\to \infty$) implies $r(x_n,\vec 0)\to 0$, hence $x_n\to\vec 0$.
