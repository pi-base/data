Every open half line emanating from the origin is
isometric to {S25}
and {S25|P42}.

It remains to show that the origin admits a local base of path connected neighbourhoods.

A ball centered at zero $B_r(\vec 0, \varepsilon)$ coincides with the Euclidean ball. Every
point $\vec x\in B_r(\vec 0, \varepsilon)$ can be joined with the origin
by a path $t\mapsto (1-t)\vec x$.
