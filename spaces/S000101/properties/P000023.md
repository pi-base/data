Let $x$ be any point and let $U$ be a neighborhood of $x$.  Let $V\subset U$ be a basic open set.  That is, $V$ is a product of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ which is all of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ in all but finitely many coordinates.  Let $\alpha$ be one of the coordinates where $V$ is all of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ in that coordinate.  Then define for each $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ $A_n$ to be the set of all $u\in U$ such that $u_\alpha=n$.  Then we see that the collection $\{A_n\}$ is a covering of $U$ which has no finite subcovering, hence $U$ is not compact.
