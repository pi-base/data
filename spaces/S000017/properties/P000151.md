A winning strategy $\sigma$ may be defined such that $\sigma(\mathcal U_0)$ is an arbitrary element of $\mathcal U_0$, and we may choose a surjective $x(\mathcal U_0):\omega\to X\setminus\sigma(\mathcal U_0)$. Finally, let $\sigma(\mathcal U_0,\cdots,\mathcal U_n,\mathcal U_{n+1})$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal U_{n+1}$ covering $x(\mathcal U_0)(n)$.
