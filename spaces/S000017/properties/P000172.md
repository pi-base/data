If $p\in\overline{A}$ and $A$ is countable, then $p\in A$ so one can take a constant sequence. If $A$ is uncountable, pick any sequence $(x_\lambda)_{\lambda < \omega_1}$ of distinct points such that $x_\lambda\in A$. If $U$ is any neighourhood of $p$, then $x_\lambda\notin U$ for at most countably many $\lambda$. If $\beta$ is supremum of those $\lambda$, then $\beta < \omega_1$ since $\text{cf}(\omega_1) = \omega_1$, and so $x_\lambda\in U$ for $\lambda > \beta$. It follows that $(x_\lambda)_{\lambda < \omega_1}$ converges to $p$.
