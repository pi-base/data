Suppose $A\subseteq X$ is infinite and let $(x_n)\subseteq A$ be a sequence of distinct elements of $A$. If $U_n = X\setminus \{x_m : m\geq n\}$ then the sequence $(U_n)$ is increasing, consists of open sets, and $\bigcup_n U_n = X$. If $A$ were relatively compact then there would be $n$ for which $A\subseteq U_n$. But $x_n\in A\setminus U_n$ so that's impossible.

Since relatively compact subsets of $X$ are finite, if $X$ were {P71} it would be countable. But {S17|P65}.
