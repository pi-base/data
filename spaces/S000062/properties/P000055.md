Assume $d:X^2\to[0,+\infty)$ is a complete metric.

Since each $q\in \mathbb Q$ is isolated in $X$, there exists $r_q>0$ such that $B_d(q,r_q)=\{q\}$.
Consider open sets $A_n=\bigcup\{B_d(q,r_q): q\in\mathbb Q,\ r_q<1/n\}=\{q\in \mathbb Q: r_q< 1/n\}$.
Since $\mathbb Q$ is dense in $X$, each $A_n$ is dense in $X$ but $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A_n=\emptyset$ which contradicts the Baire property.
