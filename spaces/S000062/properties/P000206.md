We describe the winning strategy for player 2. It relies on Cantor's intersection theorem and is based on the one suitable for {S25}.

If $x_n\in\mathbb Q$ for some $n\in\omega$, then the move $V_n=\{x_n\}$ of player 2 essentially finishes the game.

For $x_n\notin\mathbb Q$ we know that there exists a closed interval $I_n\subset U_n$, with $x_n$ in the (Euclidean) interior and length not exceeding $\frac 1n$. Player 2 can pick $V_n=\mathrm{int}(I_n)$. Then $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n=
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \overline{V_n}$ and the latter is the intersection of descending
closed subsets of {S25}
with their diameters decreasing to $0$, which in a complete metric space is nonempty.
