Suppose $p$ is a point on the $x$-axis and consider a circle in $X$ that is tangent to the $x$-axis at the point $p$.  By examining "butterfly neighborhoods" of $p$, it is easy to check that an arc starting at $p$ and following the circle will be continuous.

On the other hand, two points above the $x$-axis can be joined by an arc following a straight line.  By combining both types of arc, one can construct an arc between any two points of $X$.
