For a point above the $x$-axis, each of its neighborhoods contains a closed neighborhood of the point, just as in Euclidean space.

And for a point on the $x$-axis, the closure of one of its "butterfly neighborhoods" coincides with the closure in the Euclidean topology.  From this, it follows that each butterfly neighborhood contains the closure of a smaller butterfly neighborhood.
