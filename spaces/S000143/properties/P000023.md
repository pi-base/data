Given a decreasing sequence of real numbers $a_0>a_1>a_2>\cdots$ converging to $0$ and given a point $q=\langle x,0\rangle$ on the $x$-axis, the set of points $\langle x,a_n\rangle$ ($n\in\omega$) on the vertical line above $q$ is closed in $X$, but also infinite and discrete, hence not compact.  If $p$ is a point on the $x$-axis, every neighborhood of $p$ contains such a set (with some $q\ne p$).  So $p$ has no compact neighborhood.
