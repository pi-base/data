$X$ contains the closed subspace
$\bigl( (0, 1] \times \{0\}^\omega \bigr) \cup \bigl( [0, 1) \times \{1\}^\omega \bigr)$,
which is homeomorphic to {S93}
(by the map sending $\left<x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots\right>$ to $\left<x_0,x_1\right>$).

{S93|P76}, so neither is $X$
since the {P76} property is hereditary with respect to closed sets.
