Given a point $a=\left<a_0,a_1,\dots\right>\ne\min X$,
one can find an increasing sequence of points $x^{(n)}\in X$ converging to $a$
(i.e., cofinal in $(\leftarrow,a)$) as follows.

If the values $a_0,a_1,\dots$ are non-zero infinitely many times,
define
$$x^{(n)}=\left<a_0,\dots,a_n,0,0,\dots\right>\in(\leftarrow,a).$$
The sequence $(x^{(n)})_n$ is non-decreasing and by removing repeated entries
one obtains an increasing subsequence converging to $a$.

Otherwise, $a=\left<a_0,\dots,a_{m-1},a_m,0,0,\dots\right>$ with $a_m$ the last non-zero value.
Take an increasing sequence $b_1<b_2<\dots$ in $[0,1]$ converging to $a_m$ and define
$$x^{(n)}=\left<a_0,\dots,a_{m-1},b_n,0,0,\dots\right>\in(\leftarrow,a).$$
The sequence $(x^{(n)})_n$ is increasing and converges to $a$.

Similarly, given a point $a\ne\max X$,
one can find an decreasing sequence of points $y^{(n)}\in X$ converging to $a$.

So for $a\notin\{\min X,\max X\}$, the countably many intervals
$(x^{(n)},y^{(n)})$ form a local base at $a$.  And for $a\in\{\min X,\max X\}$
one can use the intervals $[a,y^{(n)})$ or $(x^{(n)},a]$.
