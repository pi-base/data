Consider $S^1$ as the quotient space $[-\infty, \infty] / \sim$ where $-\infty \sim \infty$. Consider the "origin" of $S^1$ to be the equivalence class of $\infty$. Now define $X$ to consists of $(-\infty, \infty)$ plus two "origins" $\{\infty_1\}$ and $\{\infty_2\}$. Define a map $f: X \to X$ by $f(\infty_1) = \infty_2$, $f(\infty_2) = \infty_1$, and $f(a) = a + 1$ for $a \in (-\infty, \infty). $f$ is continuous and has no fixed point.
