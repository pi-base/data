    name: Cozero complemented property for a space and its Tychonoff reflection
---

The Tychonoff reflection of $X$ is {S170},
with the reflection map $\varphi:X\to\mathbb S^1$ sending the two "origins" $0_1,0_2$ to $0$ and every other point to itself.

Since {S170|P61}
and the reflection map $\varphi$ is open,
the result follows from Proposition 2 in {{mathse:5108293}}.
