The map $[0, 2\pi] \to X$ defined by $t \mapsto \langle t, 1 \rangle$ if $t < 2\pi$ and $2\pi \mapsto \langle 2\pi, 2\rangle$ is injective and continuous. It is clear by restricting this map to sub-intervals and reparameterizing the results that every pair of points is connected by an injective path.
