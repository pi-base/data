Using similar arguments as for {S83|P38},
one can show that any injective path $f:[0,1]\to X$ from one origin to the other
must start at one origin, go in one direction around the circle without ever backtracking,
and end up at the other origin.
So $f$ is necessarily surjective.
But its image, namely $X$, is not homeomorphic to $[0,1]$,
for example because {S209|P3}.
