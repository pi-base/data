There is a quotient map $q: X \to S^1$ which sends the two origins in $X$ to the one origin in $S^1$.
By composing maps $S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ with this map, we can make any two singletons
(other than one of the origins) the zero set of some map,
but because {S209|P36}, we cannot separate these two points by clopen sets.
