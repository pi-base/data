During round $0$, Player 1 chooses an open set $U_0$ and a point $x_0\in U_0$.
The point $x_0$ has an open neighborhood $W$ homeomorphic to $[0,1]$.
So Player 2 can force the game to be played in $W$ by choosing an open neighborhood
$V_0$ of $x_0$ such that $V_0\subseteq U_0\cap W$;
and Player 2 has a winning strategy because {S158|P206}.
