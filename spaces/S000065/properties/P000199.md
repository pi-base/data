Let $I$ denenote the unit interval parameterized by $x$, and let $[0, 1]$ denote the unit interval parameterized by $t$. Let $F : I \times [0, 1] \to I$ denote the homotopy $(x, t) \mapsto (1 - t) x$ from the identity to the constant $0$ map. Let $q : I \sqcup I \to X$ denote the quotient map that defines $X$.

Obtain a homotopy $G : (I \sqcup I) \times [0, 1] \to I \sqcup I$ by composing $F \sqcup F$ with the available canonical map. Since $q \circ G$ is constant on the fibers of $q \times \mathrm{Id}_{[0, 1]}$, it follows that $q \circ G$ descends to a continuous map $X \times [0, 1] \to X$. This is a homotopy from the identity to the constant $0$ map because $F$ is.
