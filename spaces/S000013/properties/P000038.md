Let $(X, \tau_p)$ be a set with the excluded point topology. Suppose $p$ is the excluded point and that $q \in X \setminus \{p\}$. Clearly, $q$ is open because $\{q\}\cap \{0\}= \varnothing$. Suppose by contradiction that there exist a continuous injective function $\gamma:[0,1] \rightarrow X$ such that $\gamma(0)=p, \gamma(1)=q$. Injectivity implies that $\gamma^{-1}(\{q\})=\{1\}$: but $\{1\}$ is not open in $[0,1]$, a contradiction.
