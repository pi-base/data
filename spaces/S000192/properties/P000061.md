    name: Cozero complemented property for a space and its Tychonoff reflection
---

Any continuous function $f$ from $X$ to a Hausdorff space $Y$ takes the same value
at $\infty_E$ and $\infty_D$, and thus factors through the quotient space $X/\{\infty_E,\infty_D\}$
that identifies the two infinity points.
One can check that the quotient space is homeomorphic to the interval $[0,+\infty]$ of the
extended real line, and hence homeomorphic to {S158}.
Since this space is {P6}, it is the Tychonoff reflection of $X$,
with the quotient map $\varphi$ as reflection map.

The map $\varphi$ is not open, but is open at each point $x$ of the dense subset $[0,\infty)\subseteq X$
(i.e., sends neighborhoods of $x$ to neighborhoods of $f(x)$).
Since {S158|P61},
the result then follows from the Remark after Proposition 2 in {{mathse:5108293}}.
