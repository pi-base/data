A refinement of the topology defined for {S65}. Let $X=[0,\infty)\cup\{\infty_E,\infty_D\}$,
$E=2\mathbb N=\{2n:n\in\mathbb N \}$, and $D=2\mathbb N+1=\{2n+1:n\in\mathbb N\}$.
Then points of $[0,\infty)$ have their usual neighborhoods (in
the sense of {S25}), $\infty_E$ has basic neighborhoods of the form
$(a,\infty)\setminus E$, and $\infty_D$ has basic neighorhoods of the form
$(a,\infty)\setminus D$.

Constructed by M W in {{mo:460346}}.
