Let $U$ be an open set in $X$.
Fix $x_0\in U$ and define $V$ as the set of all such $x\in U$
that there exists a finite sequence $(x_k)_{k=1}^n$ of points in $U$
such that $x=x_n$ and for every $k=1,\ldots,n$ the points $x_k$ and $x_{k-1}$ belong
to an open segment contained in $U$.
It is easy to check that $V$ is path connected and is radially open.
Therefore for any $x_0\in U$ there exists a path connected
neighbourhood $V\subset U$.
