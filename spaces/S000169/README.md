The subspace $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^3: \|x\| = 1\}$ of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, consisting of points with distance 1 from the origin.

This space is homeomorphic to:
- The one-point compactification of {S176}
- The suspension of {S170}, i.e., the quotient of $S^1 \times [0,1]$ where $S^1 \times \{0\}$ is identified to a
single point and $S^1 \times \{1\}$ is identified to a single point
