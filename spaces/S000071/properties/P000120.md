Points of $A$ are isolated hence admit orderable neighbourhoods.
For points of $B\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ the base neighbourhoods are homeomorphic to an orderable {S20}.
An order on the neighbourhood $A\cup\{(0,0)\}$ of $(0,0)$ can be defined using the map
$s((i,k)):=(\min\{i,k\},i-k)\in\mathbb N\times\mathbb Z$.
We claim $(0,0)$ to be the maximal element,
and for $p,q\in A$ define $p\leq q$ iff $s(p)\leq_{lex}s(q)$.
Then $U_n((0,0))=\bigcup_{k\geq 0}((n,n+k),\rightarrow)$ and
$((i,k),\rightarrow)\supset U_{\min\{i,k\}+1}((0,0))$ and each point
in $A$ has successor and predecessor.
