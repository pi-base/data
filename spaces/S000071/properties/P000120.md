Points of $A$ are isolated hence admit orderable neighbourhoods.
For points of $B\setminus\{\langle 0,0\rangle\}$ the base neighbourhoods are homeomorphic to the orderable {S20}.
An order on the neighbourhood $V_1$ of $\langle 0,0\rangle$ can be defined using the injective map
$s(\langle i,k\rangle ):= \langle\min\{i,k\},i-k\rangle
\in\mathbb N\times\mathbb Z$.
We claim $\langle 0,0\rangle$ to be the maximal element,
and for $p,q\in V_1\cap A$ define $p\leq q$ iff $s(p)\leq_{lex}s(q)$.
Given such order on $V_1$:
1. Each point in $V_1\cap A$ has a successor and a predecessor hence is isolated in the order topology.
1. A base neighbourhood of $(0,0)$ is $V_n=\bigcup_{k\geq 0}(\langle n,n+k\rangle,\rightarrow)$ and is open in the order topology.
On the other hand, an order neighbourhood of $(0,0)$, which is of the form $(\langle i,k\rangle,\rightarrow)$,
contains the set $V_{\min\{i,k\}+1}$, and therefore is a neighbourhood in the original topology.

Hence the order topology conincides with the original topology on $V_1$.
