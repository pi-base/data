Let $I = [0, 1]$.
We view {S51} $K$ as the quotient space of {S25} with the quotient map $p \colon \mathbb R \to K$ defined by $p(i) = 2 i$ and $p(x) = 2 i + 1$ if $i < x < i + 1$, for all $i \in \mathbb Z$.

Define a continuous map $G \colon \mathbb R \times I \to \mathbb R$ with \[ G(x, t) = \operatorname{sgn} x \cdot \min\left\{ \left|x\right|, \frac t {1 - t} \right\}, \]
then $p \circ G$ is a continuous map from $\mathbb R \times I \to K$.

Moreover, we have \[ p(x) = p(y) \implies p \bigl( G(x, t) \bigr) = p \bigl( G(y, t) \bigr), \quad \forall x, y \in \mathbb R, \forall t \in I, \]
this induces a map $F \colon K \times I \to K$ such that $F(p(x), t) = p \bigl( G(x, t) \bigr)$.

By Whitehead's theorem (Theorem 3.3.17 in {{zb:0684.54001}}), $p \times \mathrm{id}_I \colon \mathbb R \times I \to K \times I$ is also a quotient map, and $F \circ (p \times \mathrm{id}_I) = p \circ G$ is continuous, so $F$ is continuous.

Actually $F$ gives a homotopy from $K$ to $\{0\}$ since $F(x, 1) = x$ and $F(x, 0) = 0$.
Therefore, $K$ is {P199}.
