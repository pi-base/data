The integers $\mathbb Z$ with basis $\{\{2i-1,2i,2i+1\}\mid i\in\mathbb Z\}\cup\{\{2i+1\}\mid i\in\mathbb Z\}$.

It is the unique {P205} that is irreducibly so, that is, where no proper subset is itself a cut point space. See {{doi:10.1090/s0002-9939-99-04839-x}} for a proof.

Also named the *digital line* in the subject of digital topology, e.g. in {{doi:10.32219/isms.80.1_15}}.
