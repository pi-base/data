The integers $\mathbb Z$ with $\{\{2i-1,2i,2i+1\}\mid i\in\mathbb Z\}\cup\{\{2i+1\}\mid i\in\mathbb Z\}$ as a basis for the topology.

It is the unique {P205} such that no proper subspace is also a cut point space.
See Theorem 4.5 of {{doi:10.1090/s0002-9939-99-04839-x}} for a proof.

Also named the *digital line* in the subject of digital topology, e.g. in {{doi:10.32219/isms.80.1_15}}.
