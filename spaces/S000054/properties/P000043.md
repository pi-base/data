Consider two distinct points $(a,i),(b,j)\in U\times\{0,1\} \subset X$ with $U$ some open interval in $\mathbb R$.

If $a\ne b$, let $f':[0,1]\to U$ be an injective path from $a$ to $b$ and let $g:[0,1] \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be any function with $g(0)=i$ and $g(1)=j$. Then $f=f'\times g$ is an injective path in $X$ from $(a,i)$ to $(b,j)$.

If $a=b$, one can construct an injective path in $U\times\{0,1\}$ from $(a,0)$ to $(a,1)$
by concatenating two paths built as in the previous paragraph,
one from $(a,0)$ to a point $(c,0)$ with $c\in U$, $c\ne a$,
followed by a path from $(c,0)$ to $(a,1)$, with the two paths intersecting only in $(c,0)$.
