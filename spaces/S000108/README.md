The Stone-Čech compactification of {S2}.
One way to describe $X=\beta \omega$ is as the set of all ultrafilters on $\omega=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$,
where we identify $n \in \omega$ with the principal ultrafilter containing $n$.
The topology on $X$ is generated by all sets of the form
$\overline U = \{F \in \beta\omega : U \in F\}$ for $U \subseteq \omega$.

Defined as counterexample #111 ("Stone-Čech Compactification of the Integers")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}.
