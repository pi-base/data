Suppose $x\in\mathbb Q$ has a metrizable neighbourhood. We may and do assume it is
some open interval $U\subset\mathbb R$ and denote the metric on $U$ by $d$. The subset $U\cap\mathbb Q$ is closed, hence
we can define $A_n=\{y\in U\setminus\mathbb Q: d(y,U\cap\mathbb Q)>\frac 1n \}$ for $n\in\mathbb N$.
By Baire cathegory theorem the Euclidean closure of
$A_N$ for some $N\in\mathbb N$ has nonempty interior $V$ (we can extend each $A_n$ by a different rational number
or refer to {S28|P64}).
The elements of $A_N\cap V$ cannot be then approximated
by rational numbers in $d$.
