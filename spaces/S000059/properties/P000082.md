Suppose an open interval $U$ is a metrizable neighbourhood $x\in\mathbb Q$.
For $y\in U\setminus \mathbb Q$ there exists $r>0$
such that $B(y,r)\subset U\setminus\mathbb Q$.
For some interval $V\subset U$ we have
$B(y,r/2)\supset V\setminus\mathbb Q$,
therefore $\overline{B(y,r/2)}\supset V \supset V\cap \mathbb Q$ while we know that the closed ball
$\bar B(y,r/2)$ does not contain rational numbers.
