Suppose an open interval $U$ is a neighbourhood of $x\in\mathbb Q$ with $U$ metrizable by a metric $d$.
For $y\in U\setminus \mathbb Q$ there exists $r>0$
such that $B(y,r)\subset U\setminus\mathbb Q$,
where $B(y,r)$ is the ball with respect to $d$.
Since $B(y,r/2)$ is a neighbourhood of $y$, it contains $V\setminus\mathbb Q$ for some open interval $V\subset U$.
Therefore $\overline{V\setminus\mathbb Q}=V\subset\overline{B(y,r/2)}\subset B(y,r)$,
which is impossible because $B(y,r)$ does not contain rational numbers.
