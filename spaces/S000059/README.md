Let $D=\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$, the set of irrational numbers.
The space $X$ is $\mathbb R$ with the topology generated by the Euclidean open sets
together with the sets of the form $D\cap U$ with $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ Euclidean open.

The topology is finer than {S25}.
And it is coarser than {S61}
and coarser than {S63}.

Defined as counterexample #67 ("Indiscrete Irrational Extension of $\mathbb{R}$")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
