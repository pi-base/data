Let $x,y \in X$ be distinct.

* If $x,y \in \omega$, then $\{ x \}$ and $\{ y \}$ are disjoint open neighborhoods of $x,y$, respectively.
* If $x = F, y \in \omega$, then $\omega \setminus \{ y \}$ is an open neighborhood of $x$, and $\{ y \}$ is an open neighborhood of $y$, and these are disjoint.
