Let $[0, \omega_1]$ denote {S39}. In the case $p \in X$ equals the equivalence class $\{0, \omega_1\}$ of the identified endpoints, $X \backslash \{p\}$ is homeomorphic to {S153}. Otherwise, $X \backslash \{p\}$ is homeomorphic to the identification space $((0, \omega_1] \sqcup [0, 1))/\sim$ obtained by identifying $\omega_1 \in (0, \omega_1]$ with $0 \in [0, 1)$. Since $X \backslash \{p\}$ is connected in both cases, $X$ has no cut points.
