Let $L=(\omega_1\times[0,1))\cup\{(\omega_1,0)\}$ be the {S39}
with minimum element $m=(0,0)$ and maximum element $M=(\omega_1,0)$.
The long circle is the quotient space $X=L/\{m,M\}$ obtained by identifying $m$ and $M$.
Let $q:L\to X$ denote the quotient map, and let $p=q(m)=q(M)$ be the identified point.

Fix an element $z$ with $m<z<M$ in $L$.
The interval $[m,z]$ in $L$ is homeomorphic to the interval $[0,1]\subseteq\mathbb R$
(see for example {{mathse:700187}}).
So there is a continuous function on $[m,z]$ with $f(m)=f(z)=0$ and $f(x)>0$ for $m<x<z$.
Extending this function to have value $0$ outside of $[m,z]$, one get a continuous
$f:L\to\mathbb R$ with common value $0$ at $m$ and $M$.
Factoring $f$ via $q$ provides a continuous $F:X\to\mathbb R$ with corresponding
cozero set $U=\text{coz}(F)=(m,z)\subseteq X$.
The function $F$ has constant value zero on $q([z,M])$.

*Claim*: $U$ does not have a cozero complement in $X$.
Indeed, suppose $V=\text{coz}(G)$, with $G:X\to\mathbb R$, is a cozero set disjoint from $U$.
Necessarily, $G(p)=0$ since $p\in\overline U$.
The continuous function $g=G\circ q:L\to\mathbb R$ satisfies $g(M)=0$.
By the properties of {S39},
$g$ has constant value $0$ on a whole interval $[w,M]$ for some $w<M$ in $L$
(see the "Related spaces" section of {{mathse:5106636}}).
So $G$ has constant value zero on $q([w,M])$
and therefore $U\cup V$ is not dense in $X$.
