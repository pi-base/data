The idea is similar to the proof that {S141|P61}.

Let $[0, \omega_1]$ denote {S39} and
let $q:[0, \omega_1]\to X$ be the quotient map that identifies $0$ and $\omega_1$.
Let $p=q(0)=q(\omega_1)\in X$ be the identified point.

The set $U=(0,1)\subseteq q([0, \omega_1])$ is a cozero set in $X$.
If $V=\text{coz}(g)$, with $g:X\to\mathbb R$, is a cozero set disjoint from $U$,
necessarily $g(p)=0$ and $g$ has constant value $0$ on a whole interval
$q([x,\omega_1])$ for some $x$ with $0<x<\omega_1$.
So $U\cup V$ is not dense in $X$.
