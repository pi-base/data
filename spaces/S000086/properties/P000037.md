Any two points with at least one of them in $A$ are contained in a subspace of $X$
homeomorphic to {S83},
and {S83|P37}.

So, given two points $x$ and $y$, choose a point $z\in A$ with different first coordinate than $x$ and $y$.  Then take a path from $x$ to $z$, followed by a path from $z$ to $y$.
