Let $\mathcal B$ be a countable base of the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb R$.
As a $\sigma$-locally finite network $\mathcal N$ take the union of the countably many families
$\{B{\times}\{0\} \}$ for $B\in \mathcal B$ and
$\{\{(x,1)\}: x\in \mathbb R\}$. Each of these families is locally finite,
as every point of $X$ admits a neighbourhood intersecting at most one set from each of those families.

$\mathcal N$ is a refinement of a base of the topology on $X$,
hence it is a network.
