If $d:X^2\to[0,+\infty)$ was a semimetric, then for every $x\in\mathbb R$ there would
exist $r_x>0$ such that $B_d((x,0),r_x)\subseteq \mathbb R\times\{0\}$.
Let $A_n:=\{x\in\mathbb R: r_x>1/n\}$. Since $\mathbb R = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$ is uncountable,
so is $A_m$ for some $m\geq 1$. An uncountable subset of $\mathbb R$ cannot be discrete,
hence there exists a sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty\subset A_m$ such that $a_n\to a\in \mathbb R$, and
consequently $(a_n,0)\to (a,1)$ in $X$. But $d((a_n,0),(a,1))>1/m$ which is a contradiction.
