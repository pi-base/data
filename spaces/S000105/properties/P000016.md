Let $d$ be the sup-norm metric on $I^I$, let $f\in I^I\setminus X$, and find $x,y\in I$ such that $x\geq y$ but $f(x)< f(y)$. Then, for every $g\in X$, $d(f,g) \geq \frac{1}{2}(f(y)-f(x))$ and so $f$ admits an open neighbourhood in $I^I\setminus X$. It follows that $X$ is a closed subset of a compact space and therefore compact itself.
