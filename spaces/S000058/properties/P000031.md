Let $\mathscr U=\{ U_i\cup(V_i\cap\mathbb Q)\}_{i\in I}$ be an open cover of $X$, where the sets $U_i$ and $V_i$ are open in the Euclidean topology.

Consider $X_1=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$ with the Euclidean topology. It is then {P31} and there exists open cover $\mathscr V_1$ of $X_1$
which is a point-finite refinement of $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$. Similarily, there exists a point-finite open refinement $\mathscr V_2$ of the open cover $\{V_i\cap \mathbb Q\}_{i\in I}$ of the space $X_2=\mathbb Q\cap \bigcup_{i\in I} V_i$ (topology induced on $X_2$ from $X$ coincides with the Euclidean topology and is {P31}).

Then $\mathscr V_1\cup \mathscr V_2$ is a point-finite open refinement of $\mathscr U$.
