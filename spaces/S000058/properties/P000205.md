To show $X$ is {P36}, suppose by contradiction that $X=A\cup B$ is a partition of $X$ into open subsets, with $a<b$, $a\in A$, $b\in B$.
Then $x:=\inf(B\cap(a,+\infty) ) \ge a$. Considering the base for the topology one can observe that an open set cannot contain its infimum, hence $x\in A$. Then $[a,x+\varepsilon)\cap\mathbb Q\subset A$ for some $\varepsilon >0$, implying $A=\overline{A}\supset [a,x+\varepsilon]$
and contradicting the definition of $x$.

And every $x\in X$ is a cut point, since the two open sets $(-\infty,x)$ and $(x,+\infty)$ partition $X\setminus \{x\}$.
