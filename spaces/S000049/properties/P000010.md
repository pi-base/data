Given a prime $p$, the singleton $U_p=\{p\}$ is open and does not contain a regular open neighborhood of $p$. Indeed, $\operatorname{cl}(\{p\})=\{n\in X\mid p\text{ divides } n\}$ contains the open set $U_{p^2}=\{p^2,p\}$, and therefore $\operatorname{int}(\operatorname{cl}(\{p\}))$ is not contained in $\{p\}$.
