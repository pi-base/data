Let $A \subseteq X$ with its subspace topology.
If $\infty \in A$, then any open cover of $A$ contains $A$ itself, as $X$ is the only neighborhood of $\infty$ in $X$. In particular $A$ is compact and therefore paracompact.
If $\infty \notin A$, we can view $A$ as a subspace of {S27}. So as {S27|P216}, $A$ is paracompact.
