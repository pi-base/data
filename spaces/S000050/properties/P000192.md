Any nonempty closed subset $A$ of $X$ has to contain $\infty$. If $A = \{\infty\}$, then $A$ clearly has a generic point. Otherwise,
assume $\{\infty\} \subsetneq A$ and $A$ is {P39}. We see that $A$ cannot contain more than one point of
$\mathbb{Q}$, as {S27|P3} and $\mathbb{Q}$ is open in $X$. Thus, $A = \{q,\infty\}$ for some
$q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q$ is a generic point of $A$.
