Let $X$ be the unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. For a point $(x,y)$ not on the diagonal (for $x \ne y$), neighborhoods are given by the intervals of vertical slices $\{x\} \times (y - \varepsilon,y + \varepsilon)$ for $\varepsilon > 0$. For a point $(x,x)$ on the diagonal, open neighborhoods are given by the incomplete horizontal strips $S \times (x - \varepsilon,x + \varepsilon)$ for $\varepsilon > 0$ and $x \notin S$, $[0,1] \setminus S$ finite.

Every vertical slice is homeomorphic to {S158}. Every horizontal slice is homeomorphic to {S154}, with the homeomorphism sending the point on the diagonal to $\infty$. The diagonal $\{(x,x) | x \in [0, 1]\}$ is homeomorphic to {S158}.
