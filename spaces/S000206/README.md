David Gao's example of a {P112} {P10} space that is not {P11},
as constructed in {{mathse:4996886}}.

The underlying set is $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty [\frac{2}{3^n},\frac{1}{3^{n-1}}]$. The topology is generated by open sets in {S25} and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$. The construction is similar to
that of {S56}.
