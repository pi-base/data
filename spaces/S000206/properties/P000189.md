Let $X = \bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i$ where $I$ is a countable index set and $X_i \subset X$ are all closed. Note that the
subspace $(-\infty,0)$ is homeomorphic to {S25}, which is {P189}, so exactly one
$X_i$ intersects $(-\infty,0)$ and in fact contains $(-\infty,0)$. Denote it by $X_{i_0}$. Note that the closure of
$(-\infty,0)$ is $(-\infty,0]$, so $0 \in X_{i_0}$. Similarly, exactly one $X_i$ intersects $(0,\infty)$ and in fact contains
$(0,\infty)$, which we shall denote by $X_{i_1}$. Again, we have $0\in X_{i_1}$, so $X_{i_0}$ intersects $X_{i_1}$ and thus
$X_{i_0}=X_{i_1}$ covers the entire space.
