Let $A$ be as in the definition of the space. Then $X \setminus A$ is an open neighborhood of $0$. Thus, if $X$ is
{P41}, there must be an open set $U \subset X \setminus A$ containing $0$ that is connected. Note that the
subspace topology on $X \setminus A$ coincides with the subspace topology inherited from {S25},
so $U$ is a connected open neighborhood of $0$ in $X \setminus A$ under the Euclidean topology. It is easy to see that no such
$U$ exists.
