If $X$ is {P37}, there will be a path $f:[0,1]\to X$ from $0$ to $1$. Any such path will also be a path from
$0$ to $1$ in {S25}, so it must contain $[0,1]$ and thus also $A$ in the definition of the space.
Hence, $A$ is a closed subset of the {P16} space $f([0,1])$, so $A$ is compact itself. However, it is easy to check
that, for every $n\ge 1$, $I_n=[\frac{2}{3^n},\frac{1}{3^{n-1}}]$ is open in the subspace topology on $A$, and $A$ is the
union of all such $I_n$ but not finitely many of them, contradicting compactness.
