Since {S25|P56}, it suffices to show nowhere dense sets in $X$ are also nowhere dense
in the Euclidean topology. Let $A \subset X$ be nowhere dense, and let $\overline{A}$ be the closure of $A$ in $X$. Since the
topology on $X$ coincides with the Euclidean topology away from $0$, the closure of $A$ under the Euclidean topology is either
$\overline{A}$ or $\overline{A} \cup \{0\}$. Since the topology on $X$ is coarser than the Eucldiean topology, the
Euclidean-interior of $\overline{A}$ is contained in the interior of $\overline{A}$ in $X$, which is empty as $A$ is nowhere
dense in $X$. That is, $\overline{A}$ has empty interior in the Euclidean topology, from which it is immediate that
$\overline{A} \cup \{0\}$ also has empty interior in the Euclidean topology. Thus, $A$ is nowhere dense in the Euclidean
topology, as required.
