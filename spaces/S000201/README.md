The subspace of {S176} defined by

$\quad X=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:\left(x-\frac{1}{n}\right)^2+y^2=\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2\right\}$

that is, the union of circles of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ centered at $(\frac{1}{n},0)$ for positive
integers $n$.

Defined as "infinite earring" in section 71 of {{zb:0951.54001}}.
Not to be confused with {S139}.
