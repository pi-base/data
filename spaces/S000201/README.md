The subspace of {S176} defined by

$\quad X=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:\left(x-\frac{1}{n}\right)^2+y^2=\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2\right\}$

that is, the union of circles of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ centered at $(\frac{1}{n},0)$ for positive
integers $n$.

Not to be confused with {S139}, which has a finer topology.

Defined as "infinite earring" in section 71 of {{zb:0951.54001}}.
Appears as Example 1.25 in {{zb:1044.55001}} (available [here](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html)) under the name "Shrinking wedge of circles"; however, note that it is not actually an example of a "wedge sum" as defined in e.g. {{wikipedia:Wedge_sum}}, {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-4576-6}}.
