By construction, the topology on $X$ is finer than the product topology on $\omega_1^\omega$, where $\omega_1$ is equipped with the discrete topology. The said product topology on $\omega_1^\omega$ is generated by the Baire metric,

$$d(\langle \alpha_i \rangle, \langle \beta_i \rangle) = \frac{1}{i}$$

where $i$ is the first coordinate s.t. $x_i \neq y_i$. See {S102}.
