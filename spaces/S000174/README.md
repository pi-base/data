$X = \omega_1^\omega$ equipped with the topology generated by the basis $U \cap \xi^\omega$ where $\xi < \omega_1$ and $U \subset \omega_1^\omega$ is open in the product topology, where $\omega_1$ is equipped with the discrete topology.

Constructed by R. Pol in {{doi:10.4064/FM-97-2-53-55}} to obtain an example of a
{P67}, {P82}, and non-{P30} space.
