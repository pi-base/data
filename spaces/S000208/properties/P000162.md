Extend $\varphi$ to $\Pi$ so that if $E = E_r$ and $s_n\to r$ then $\varphi(p_E) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \varphi(s_n)$. If $\varphi(p_E)\in U$ where $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open, find $N$ such that $s_n\in U$ for $n\geq N$, then $V =\overline{E}\setminus\varphi^{-1}(\{s_1, s_2, ..., s_N\})$ is an open neighbourhood of $p_E$ and $\varphi(V)\subseteq U$. This shows that $\varphi:\Pi\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. By definition it's clearly a bijection. From corollary 8.18 of {{10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}, $\Pi$ is realcompact.
