$X$ is the subspace of the product $\prod_{n\in\omega}(\omega_{n+1}+1)$ with the box topology consisting of all $f\in \prod_{n\in \omega}(\omega_{n+1}+1)$ such that $\omega< \text{cf}(f(n))$ for all $n$ (see {{wikipedia:Cofinality#Cofinality_of_ordinals_and_other_well-ordered_sets}}).

Defined (as the space called $X'$) and shown to be the Hewitt realcompactification of {S138} in section IV.4 of {{zb:0224.54019}} 
(see remark 8.8 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}} for the definition of Hewitt realcompactification).
