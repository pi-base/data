Let $p, q \in X$ be arbitrary distinct points.
Define $f(x) = \begin{cases} q & x = p, \\ p & x = q, \\ x & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases}$ then $f(x)$ is involutary and continuous since for every open subset $U$ and every point $x \in X$, both $U \setminus \{x\} = U \cap \left( X \setminus \{x\} \right)$ and $U \cup \{x\}$ are open.
