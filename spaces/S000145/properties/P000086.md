Let $p, q \in X$ be arbitrary distinct points.
Define $f(x) = \begin{cases} q & \text{if }x = p, \\ p & \text{if }x = q, \\ x & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}$

Then $f(x)$ is involutary and continuous since for every open subset $U$ and every point $x \in X$, both $U \setminus \{x\} = U \cap \left( X \setminus \{x\} \right)$ and $U \cup \{x\}$ are open.
