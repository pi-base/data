Let $Y$ be a {P36} subset of $X$ with at least two points.
If $Y$ is closed in $X$, by the property of ultrafilters all subsets of $Y$ are closed, thus $Y$ is {P52}, which is not possible.
This implies that $Y$ is open, that is, every {P36} subsets of $X$ must be open.

Now, because $X$ is {P36}, $X$ cannot be partitioned into two nonempty open subsets.
We conclude that $X$ cannot be partitioned into two {P36} subsets, each with at least two points.
