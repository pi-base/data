Let $A$ be an infinite closed proper subset of $X$, and take an arbitrary $p \in X \setminus A$.
For each $S \subseteq A$, the function $f_S:X\to X$ defined by
$$f_S(x) = \begin{cases} p & \text{if }x\in S, \\ x & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases}$$
is continuous since for every nonempty open set $U$, its inverse image $f^{-1}(U)$ contains $U\setminus A$, which is open and nonempty; hence $f^{-1}(U)$ is open.

And there are continuum many such functions $f_S$.
