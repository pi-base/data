Let $A = \{a_0, a_1, \dots\}$ be any infinite closed subset of $X$, and take arbitrary $p \in X \setminus A$.
Then for each $S \subseteq \mathbb N$, the function \[ f_S(x) = \begin{cases} p & x = a_i, i \in S, \\ x & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases} \] is continuous since the preimage of any open subset $U$ is of the form $U \setminus Q$ or $\left( U \cup \{p\} \right) \setminus Q$ where $Q \subseteq A$ is closed.

These $f_S$ induced continuum many continuous function from $X$ to itself.
