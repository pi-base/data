The space $X$ is the set $\omega$ with topology $\tau=\mathscr U\cup\{\emptyset\}$,
where $\mathscr U$ is a free ultrafilter on $\omega$.

The space is described for example in {{mathse:3088994}} and as item (3) in Theorem 1 of {{zb:1400.39025}}.

Not to be confused with {S111}.

Note: The topology on $X$ depends on the choice of ultrafilter.  There are $2^{\mathfrak c}$ homeomorphism classes of such spaces (see for example {{mathse:34841}}).  However, the properties currently tracked in Ï€-Base for this space do not depend on that choice.
