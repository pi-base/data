name: Right "open-ray" topology on $[0,1]\cap\mathbb Q$
---

The set $X=[0,1]\cap\mathbb Q$ with its order induced from $\mathbb R$, and the topology generated by a base of open sets consisting of $X$ and all the intervals $(x,\rightarrow)$ for $x\in X$.

The additional open sets are the sets of the form $(\theta,1]\cap\mathbb Q$ for an irrational $\theta\in(0,1)$.
Note that the "closed rays" $[x,\rightarrow)$ for $x\in X\setminus\{0\}$ are not open sets.

Compare with the finer topology of {S150}.
