For every irrational $\theta\in[0,1]$ there exists
a contiunuous self-map of $X$ such that its set
of fixed points is exactly $[0,\theta)\cap\mathbb Q$.

To construct such a map for given
$\theta\in[0,1]\setminus\mathbb Q$, consider the sequence
$a_n:=\theta+\frac{1-\theta}{n+1}$
and fix $b\in(a_2,a_1)\cap\mathbb Q$.
Then pick increasing bijections between rational intervals (c.f. Cantor's isomorphism theorem, 9.3 in {{doi:10.1007/978-93-80250-91-5_9}})
$(a_{n+1},a_n)\to(a_{n+2},a_{n+1})$ for $n\geq 1$ and $(a_1,1]\to(a_2,b]$.
Together with the identity on $[0,\theta)\cap X$ we obtain an increasing bijection
onto interval $[0,b]\cap\mathbb Q$.
It is therefore a continuous self-map of $X$.
