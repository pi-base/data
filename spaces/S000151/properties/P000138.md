For every irrational $\theta\in[0,1]$ there exists
a contiunuous self-map of $X$ such that its set
of fixed points is exactly $[0,\theta)\cap\mathbb Q$.

The construction of a map $(\theta,1]\cap X \to (\theta,1]\cap X$ with no fixed point is analogous as in the proof that

(use only the sequence $b_k$).
