Let $(a,b)$ be a point in the space.  That is, $a$ is a countable ordinal and $b\in I^I$.  Then the set $[0,a+1]\times I^I$ is a compact neighborhood of $(a,b)$.  It is compact because it is the product of compact sets.  It is a neighborhood because $[0,a+1)\times I^I$ is an open set containing $(a,b)$.
