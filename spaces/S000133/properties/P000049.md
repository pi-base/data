The topology on this space is discrete except at $(0,0)$, where the open sets are the standard open sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$.  That is, a set $A$ is open if either $(0,0)\notin A$ or $A$ contains a (standard) ball about $(0,0)$.  

Consider the set $A=\{(1/n,0)\mid n\in \mathbb{N}\}$.  We see that $A$ is an open set because any set not containing the origin is open.   Its closure is $A\cup \{(0,0)\}$, which is not open.

See item #4 for space #139 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}.
