Note that the space is {P53} by construction.

So suppose that $\langle x_n \rangle$ is a Cauchy sequence that does not converge to the particular point $0$.  Then there is $\varepsilon>0$ and a subsequence $x_{n_i}$ such that $p(x_{n_i},0)=d(x_{n_1},0)\ge \varepsilon$.  Let $N$ be an index such that $p(x_n,x_m)<\varepsilon$ for all $n,m\ge N$.  Let $I$ be the first natural number with $n_I\ge N$ and let $n\ge N$ be arbitrary. We have $d(x_n,0)+d(x_{n_I},0)\ge d(x_{n_I},0)\ge \varepsilon$, and therefore we must conclude that $p(x_n,x_{n_I})\not=d(x_n,0)+d(x_{n_I},0)$ and thus $x_{n}=x_{n_I}$. Hence $\langle x_n \rangle$ is constant for $n\ge N$ and therefore convergent.
