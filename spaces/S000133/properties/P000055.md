Note that the space is {P53} by
considering the post office metric on $\mathbb R$.

So suppose that $\langle x_n \rangle$ is a Cauchy sequence that 
does not converge to $0$.  Then there is $\varepsilon>0$ and a 
subsequence $x_{n_i}$ such that 
$d(x_{n_i},0)=\|x_{n_i}\|\ge \varepsilon$.
Let $N$ be an index such that $d(x_n,x_m)<\varepsilon$ for all 
$n,m\ge N$.  Let $I$ be a natural number with $n_I\ge N$ and let 
$n\ge N$ be arbitrary. We have 
$\|x_n\|+\|x_{n_I}\|\ge d(x_{n_I},0)\ge \varepsilon$, and 
therefore we must conclude that 
$d(x_n,x_{n_I})\not=\|x_n\|+\|x_{n_I}\|$ and thus $x_{n}=x_{n_I}$.
Hence $\langle x_n \rangle$ is constant for $n\ge N$ and therefore
convergent.
