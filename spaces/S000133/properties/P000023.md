The particular point does not have a compact neighborhood.  Indeed, let $U$ be a neighborhood of $p$.  Then there is  some $V_n\subseteq U$.  The collection $\mathcal{A} = \{\{x\}: x\in U\setminus V_{n+1}\}\cup \{V_{n+1}\}$ is an open covering of $U$ with infinitely many elements and no proper subcover.
