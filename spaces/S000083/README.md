The space $X$ is obtained by taking $\mathbb R$ ({S25}) and replacing the origin $0$ with two origins $0_1$ and $0_2$.  Basic open neighborhoods of a point $x\ne 0$ are the Euclidean neighborhoods of $x$ not containing $0$.  Basic open neighborhoods of each origin $0_i$ are of the form $(U\setminus\{0\})\cup\{0_i\}$ with $U$ a Euclidean open neighborhood of $0$.

The space can also be obtained as a quotient space of the disjoint union of $\mathbb R\times\{1\}$ and $\mathbb R\times\{2\}$ by identifying points $(x,1)$ and $(x,2)$ for $x\ne 0$.

This space is similar to {S65} and provides an example of {P123} space that is not {P3}.
