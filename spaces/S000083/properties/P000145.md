Suppose $\mathcal U$ is an open cover of $X$.  The subspace $Y=(\mathbb R\setminus\{0\})\cup\{0_1\}$ is open in $X$ and homeomorphic to $\mathbb R$.  Intersecting every element of $\mathcal U$ with $Y$ gives an open cover of $Y$, and, since {S25|P145}, we can choose a star finite open refinement $\mathcal V$ of that cover of $Y$. 

Take some $U_1\in\mathcal V$ containing $0_1$ and some $U_2\in\mathcal U$ containing $0_2$.
The set $U:=(U_1\cap U_2)\cup\{0_2\}\subseteq U_2$ is open in $X$.
We have $U\cap Y\subseteq U_1$, hence $U$ meets finitely many elements of $\mathcal V$,
and $\mathcal V':=\mathcal V\cup\{U\}$ is a star-finite open refinement of $\mathcal U$.
