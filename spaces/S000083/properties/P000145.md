Suppose $\mathcal U$ is an open cover of $X$.  The subspace $Y=(\mathbb R\setminus\{0\})\cup\{0_1\}$ is open in $X$ and homeomorphic to $\mathbb R$, hence strongly paracompact.  Intersecting every element of $\mathcal U$ with $Y$ gives an open cover of $Y$, and, since {S25|P145}, we can choose a star finite open refinement $\mathcal V$ of that cover of $Y$. 

Fix some $U_0 \in \mathcal U$ with $0_2 \in U_0$. Then $\mathcal{V}':= \mathcal{V} \cup \{(U\cap U_0)\setminus\{0_1\}\mid U \in \mathcal{V}, 0_1\in U\}$ is an open refinement of $U$.

Since $\mathcal{V}$ is star finite, $\{(U\cap U_0)\setminus\{0_1\}\mid U \in \mathcal{V}, 0_1\in U\}$ has to be finite. So $\mathcal{V}'$ is star finite as it contains only finitely more elements than the star finite $\mathcal{V}$.
