Suppose $\mathcal U$ is an open cover of $X$.  The subspace $Y=(\mathbb R\setminus\{0\})\cup\{0_1\}$ is open in $X$ and homeomorphic to $\mathbb R$, hence strongly paracompact.  Intersecting every element of $\mathcal U$ with $Y$ gives an open cover of $Y$, and, since {S25|P145} we can choose a star finite open refinement $\mathcal V$ of that cover of $Y$.  Fix some $0_2 \in U_0 \in \mathcal U$. Then $\mathcal{V}':= \mathcal{V} \cup \{(U\cap U_0)\setminus{0_1}\mid U \in \mathcal{V}, 0_1\}$ is an open refinement of $U$ which is star finite as $\mathcal{V}$ is star finite and therefore also $\mathcal{V}' \setminus \mathcal{V}$ finite.
