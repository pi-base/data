It is clear that all singletons in $X$ are closed, and so $X$ is $T_1$.

Every subspace of $X$ is of one of the following types:

* a discrete space ([finite](http://topology.jdabbs.com/spaces/1), [countable](http://topology.jdabbs.com/spaces/2), or [uncountable](http://topology.jdabbs.com/spaces/3)),
* a [countable Fort space](http://topology.jdabbs.com/spaces/20), or
* an [uncountable Fort space](http://topology.jdabbs.com/spaces/21).

As each of these is normal, $X$ is completely normal.

To independently see that $X$ is normal, suppose that $F \subseteq X$ is closed, $U \subseteq X$ is open, and $F \subseteq U$. 

* If $p \in F$, then $p \notin X \setminus U$ so $X \setminus U$ is open, so $V = U$ is clopen, and $F \subseteq V = \overline{V} \subseteq U$. 
* If $p \notin F$, then $V = F$ is clopen, and $F \subseteq V = \overline{V} \subseteq U$.
