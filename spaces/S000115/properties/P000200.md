Let $p,q\in X$ be two consecutive local maxima on the graph of $f(x)=\sin(1/x)$.
The loop $L\subseteq X$ consisting of the line segment between $p$ and $q$ and the portion of the graph of $f$ below it is homeomorphic to a circle $S^1$.
Hence $\pi_1(L)$ is non-trivial, since {S170|P200}.

On the other hand, $L$ is a retract of $X$ (by a map sending points to left of $p$ to $p$ and points to the right of $q$ to $q$).
By Proposition 1.17 of {{zb:1044.55001}}, $\pi_1(L)$ injects into $\pi_1(X)$, which is therefore non-trivial.
