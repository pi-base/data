Let $X$ be Bing's Discrete Extension Space and $Y$ Michael's Closed Subspace.

As the name suggests, $Y \subset X$ is closed because $X \setminus Y \subset X \setminus M$ and every point of $X \setminus M$ is isolated. Since $X$ is $T_4$, so is $Y$.

See item #3 for space #143 in {{zb:0386.54001}}.
