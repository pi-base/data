    name: Cozero complemented property for a space and its Tychonoff reflection
---

In order to find the Tychonoff reflection of $X$, we first determine the completely regular reflection of $X$, with topology generated by the cozero sets of $X$.  

Note that each cozero set in a topological space is a union of regular open sets.  In the current space $X$, 
a regular open set containing a point $x\in X$ also contains
a Euclidean neighborhood of $x$.
For the non-obvious case of $x=0$, it is because
$\operatorname{int}_X\text{cl}_X((-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\setminus K) =
\operatorname{int}_X[-\varepsilon,\varepsilon] = (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$.
So the topology generated by the cozero sets of $X$ is contained in the Euclidean topology of $\mathbb R$.
On the other hand, {S25|P12}.
So the completely regular reflection of $X$ is {S25}.
And since $\mathbb R$ is even Tychonoff, it is the Tychonoff reflection of $X$.

The reflection map $\varphi$ is the identity function on $\mathbb R$ as a set;
it is open at each point $x$ of the dense subset $X\setminus\{0\}\subseteq X$ (i.e., sends neighborhoods of $x$ to neighborhoods of $f(x)$).  Since {S25|P61},
the desired result then follows from the Remark after Proposition 2 in {{mathse:5108293}}.
