    name: Cozero complemented property for a space and its Tychonoff reflection
---

Any regular open set containing a point $x\in X$ also contains
a Euclidean neighborhood of $x$.
For the non-obvious case of $x=0$, it is because
$\operatorname{int}_X\text{cl}_X((-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\setminus K) =
\operatorname{int}_X[-\varepsilon,\varepsilon] = (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$.

From the fact that in any topological space any cozero set containing a point $x$
also contains a regular open set containing $x$,
it follows that the completely regular modification of $X$ (with topology generated by the cozero sets)
is {S25},
which is also Tychonoff and hence is the Tychonoff reflection of $X$.

The reflection map $\varphi$ is the identity function on $\mathbb R$ as a set;
it is open at every point $x$ of $X\setminus\{0\}$ (i.e., maps neighborhoods to neighborhoods),
and $X\setminus\{0\}$ is dense in $X$.  Since {S25|P61},
the desired result then follows from the Remark after Proposition 2 in {{mathse:5108293}}.
