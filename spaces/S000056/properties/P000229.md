The path components of $X$ are $(-\infty, 0]$ and $(0, \infty)$, which can be seen to have their usual topologies as subspaces of $\mathbb{R}$. (See {{mathse:2960540}}, which shows that $0$ and $1$ are in separate path components.)

Thus the path components are homeomorphic to {S210} and {S25}. The result follows since {S210|P229} and {S25|P229}.
