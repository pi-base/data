Let $K = \{\frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Smirnov's Deleted Sequence Topology is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ consisting of all sets of the form $U \setminus B$ where $U \subset \mathbb{R}$ is open in the standard topology and $B \subset K$.

Defined as counterexample #64 ("Smirnov's Deleted Sequence Topology")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
