Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover. There exists an open set $A \in \mathcal{U}$ with $0 \in A$, from which it follows that $(-1,1) \in A$. Since $\mathcal{U}$ is a cover, there must also be (not necessarily distinct) sets $B$ and $C$ with $-1 \in B$ and $1 \in C$. The collection $\{A, B, C\}$ is therefore a finite subcover of $\mathcal{U}$.
