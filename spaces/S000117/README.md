This space is the closure of {S116} in {S176}.

So $X$ is the union $\bigcup_{n\in\omega}L_n\cup L_\infty\subseteq\mathbb R^2$
where for each $n\in\omega$, $L_n$ is the closed line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(1,\frac{1}{n+1})$,
and $L_\infty=[0,1]\times\{0\}$ is the closed line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$.
It has the subspace topology induced from {S176}.

Defined as counterexample #120 ("The Closed Infinite Broom")
in {{zb:0386.54001}}.
