Observe that any increasing bijection
$X\to [a,b]\cap\mathbb Q$, where $0\leq a<b\leq 1$,
is a continuous self-map of $X$.


Fix $\theta \in (0,1)\setminus \mathbb Q$ and two sequences of irrational numbers $(a_k)$ and $(b_k)$
such that $1>a_k>a_{k+1}> \theta > b_{k+1}>b_k >0$
and $a_k\to \theta$, $b_k\to \theta$.
E.g. $\theta=1/\sqrt{2}$ and $a_k=\theta+\frac{1}{k+4}$, $b_k=\theta-\frac{1}{k+2}$.
Pick also $\tilde a \in (a_1,a_0)\cap\mathbb Q$
and $\tilde b\in (b_0,b_1)\cap\mathbb Q$.

From now on, to simplify the notation,
every interval is assumed to consist exclusively of rational numbers.

We construct an increasing bijection $f:X\to [\tilde b,\tilde a]$
by choosing arbitrary order isomorphism between the rational intervals:
$[0,b_0)\to[\tilde b, b_1)$, $(a_0,1]\to(a_1,\tilde a]$,
$(b_k,b_{k+1})\to(b_{k+1},b_{k+2})$, and $(a_{k+2},a_{k+1})\to(a_{k+1},a_k)$ for all $k\geq 0$.
Function $f$ being union of those increasing bijections has no fixed point.
