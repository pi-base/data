Observe that any increasing bijection
$X\to [a,b]\cap\mathbb Q$, where $0\leq a<b\leq 1$,
is a continuous self-map of $X$.

Fix $\theta \in (0,1)\setminus \mathbb Q$ and two monotone sequences of irrational numbers
$1>a_0>\ldots>a_k>a_{k+1}> \theta$
and $0<b_0<\ldots <b_k<b_{k+1}<\theta$
such that $a_k\to \theta$ and $b_k\to \theta$.
Pick also $\tilde a \in (a_1,a_0)\cap\mathbb Q$
and $\tilde b\in (b_0,b_1)\cap\mathbb Q$.

We construct an increasing bijection $f:X\to [\tilde b,\tilde a]\cap\mathbb Q$ by chooseing arbitrary bijections between the rational intervals
$[0,b_0)\to[\tilde b, b_1)$, $(a_0,1]\to(a_1,\tilde a]$ and $(b_k,b_{k+1})\to(b_{k+1},b_{k+2})$,
$(a_{k+2},a_{k+1})\to(a_{k+1},a_k)$ for $k\geq 0$.
It is evident that union of those bijections
has no fixed point.
