Observe that any increasing bijection
$X\to [a,b]\cap\mathbb Q$, where $0\leq a<b\leq 1$,
is a continuous self-map of $X$.

Consider the map $f(x):=\frac{x+1}{x+2}$.
As a function on $\mathbb R$ it admits two irrational fixed points only.
Restricted to $X$ it is an increasing bijection onto 
$[\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3}]\cap \mathbb Q$,
therefore it is a continuous self-map of $X$ with no fixed point.
