name: Right "closed-ray" topology on $[0,1]\cap\mathbb Q$
---

The set $X=[0,1]\cap\mathbb Q$ with its order induced from $\mathbb R$, and the topology generated by a base of open sets consisting of the intervals $[x,\rightarrow)$ for $x\in X$.

The open sets are exactly the [upward-closed sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_set) in the ordered set $(X,\le)$.  That includes "closed rays" $[x,\rightarrow)$ and "open rays" $(x,\rightarrow)$ for $x\in X$, as well as sets of the form $(\theta,1]\cap\mathbb Q$ for an irrational $\theta\in(0,1)$.

The closed sets are the downward-closed sets in $(X,\le)$.

Compare with the coarser topology of {S151}.
