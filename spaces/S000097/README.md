The set $\omega^2\cup\{x,y\}$ topologized by the following basis: points of $\omega^2$ are isolated,
$\{x\}\cup\{\langle i,j\rangle\in\omega^2 : i\geq f(j)\}$ is open for each $f:\omega\to\omega$, and
$\{y\}\cup\{\langle i,j\rangle\in\omega^2 : j\geq n\}$ is open for each $n<\omega$.
Put another way, neighborhoods of $x$ contain all but finitely-many points of each row of $\omega^2$,
and neighborhoods of $y$ contain all but finitely-many rows.

Equivalently, this is the one-point compactification of
a copy $\omega^2\cup\{x\}$ of
{S131} with
$y$ as its compactifying point.

Defined as counterexample #99 ("Maximal Compact Topology")
in {{zb:0386.54001}} to demonstrate
an example of a non-{P3} space which has a maximal
compact topology.
