Let $X$ consist of the open upper half plane along with a countable number of points on the $x$-axis. Let points in the upper half plane have their usual neighborhoods and let neighborhoods of points $s$ on the $x$-axis consist of discs in the upper half plane tangent to the $x$-axis at the point $s$.
