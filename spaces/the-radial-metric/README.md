If $d$ is the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the radial metric $r$ is defined by: 
$$r(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    0, & x=y \\\
    d(x,y), & \text{$x$ and $y$ lie on the same line through the origin} \\\
    d(x,(0,0)) + d(y,(0,0)), & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

This metric is also known as the [Paris metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paris_metric).
