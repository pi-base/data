The second player can alwyas pick sets of the form
$V_n=\{f\in X: f(i)=x_n(i) \text{ for }i\in F_n\}$,
where $x_n\in X$ and $F_n\subset 2^\mathfrak{c}$ is finite,
for such sets form a basis for the product topology.

Since $V_{n+1}\subseteq V_n$, we have $F_{n+1}\supseteq F_n$.
On the fountable set $F=\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty F_n$ define
$n(i):=\min\{n<\omega: i\in F_n\}$.
Then any point $f\in X$ satisfying $f(i)=x_{n(i)}(i)$,
for all $i\in F$, belongs to $\bigcap_{n<\omega} V_n$.
