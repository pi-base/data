Assume $\omega_1\subset 2^\mathfrak{c}$.
For each $\lambda\leq\omega_1$ define $f_\lambda\in X$ by
$f^{-1}(1)=[0,\lambda)$ and $f( 2^\mathfrak{c})\subset\{0,1\}$.
The set $A=\{f_\lambda: \lambda<\omega_1\}$ is not closed, since
$f_{\omega_1}$ can be readily verified to belong to the closure.

It suffices to show that $\omega_1\ni \lambda\mapsto f_\lambda\in A$ is
a homeomorphism,
since {S35|P19}.

The image if an open set $(\alpha,\lambda]\subset \omega_1$ equals
$\{f\in X: f(\alpha)=1,\ f(\lambda)=0\}\cap A$, hence is open.
On the other hand, for an open neighbourhood of $f_\lambda\in A$
given by finite $F\subset \omega_1$ (coordinated outside $\omega_1$ do not matter),
i.e. $U=\{f\in A: f|_F = f_\lambda|_F\}$, it is enough to consider
an interval $(\alpha,\lambda]$, where $\alpha=\max(F\cap(0,\lambda))$
(we can allways assume $0\in F$). Preimage of $U$ contains the interval.

<!-- The proof should be written once, for an uncountable "Cantor cube",
if ever added; Embedding of \omega_1+1 into a Cantor cube can be used. -->
