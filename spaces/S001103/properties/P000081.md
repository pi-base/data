The space contains a subspace homeomorphic to the Cantor cube $\{0,1\}^\mathfrak{c}$
which, according to Theorem 6.2.16 in {{zb:0684.54001}}, contains
a copy of {S36}, since {S36|P50}.
And {S36|P81}.

<!-- The proof should be written once, for an uncountable "Cantor cube",
if ever added; Embedding of \omega_1+1 into a Cantor cube can be used. -->
