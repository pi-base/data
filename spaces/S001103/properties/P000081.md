Consider $A=\{f\in X: f(2^\mathfrak{c})=\{0,1\},\ |f^{-1}(1)|<\aleph_0\}$
(charactersitic functions of finite subsets). It can be readily verified that $u\equiv 1$ belongs to $\overline A$.
On the other hand, if $D\subset A$ is countable, then there exists a cocountable set $S\subset 2^\mathfrak{c}$ such that
for each $f\in D$ we have $f|_S=0$. Hence $u\notin \overline D$.
