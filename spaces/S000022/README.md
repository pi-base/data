Let $X=\mathbb R$ and let $p$ be a distinguished point of $X$.
Every point not equal to $p$ is isolated and the open neighborhoods of $p$ are the cocountable subsets of $X$ containing that point.

This space is the one-point Lindelöfication of an uncountable discrete space.

Compare with {S155} and {S157}.
With a suitable assumption on $|\mathbb R|$ so that the cardinalities match, $X$ will be homeomorphic to one of them.
