Let $U_1$ and $U_2$ be nonempty open sets in $X$.  Their complements $C_1$ and $C_2$ are compact in the Euclidean topology, and so is their union $C_1\cup C_2$, which cannot be the whole of $X$ since $\mathbb{R}$ is not compact in the Euclidean topology.  This shows that the intersection of $U_1$ and $U_2$ is not empty.
