Every unbounded set $A\subseteq X$ with its subspace topology is {P39},
hence not homeomorphic to $[0,1]$.
Hence any embedding $f:[0,1]\to X$ must have a bounded image.
And since for a bounded set the subspace topology coincides with the induced Euclidean topology,
$f$ must be a path in the Euclidean space $\mathbb R$.

Now let $x\in X$ and consider the open set $U=(-\infty,x+1)\cup(x+2,+\infty)$.
Any open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ contained in $U$ would have to contain a point $y>x+2$.
But there is no Euclidean path $f:[0,1]\to U$ from $x$ to $y$.
So $V$ cannot be {P95}.
