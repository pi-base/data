Due to Jones' lemma.

Since {S57|P26}, there exist at most ${\aleph_0}^\mathfrak c=2^{\mathfrak c}$ continuous functions on $X$.
Since any subset of $X\setminus\mathbb Q$ is closed, there exist at least $2^{2^\mathfrak c}$ pairs of disjoint closed subsets,
each of which can be separated by a continuous function (Urysohn's lemma). A contradiction.
