Pick $x\in\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$ and an enumeration of
rationals $\mathbb Q=\{q_n:n<\omega\}$ such that $q_{2n}=x_n$ is the particular sequence converging to $x$.

Define the function $f:X\to \mathbb R$ as
$$f(t)=\begin{cases}
0&\text{for } t\in X\setminus \{q_{4n}:n<\omega\}\\
\frac1n &\text{for } t=q_{4n}
\end{cases},\quad t\in X.$$
It is continuous at every isolated point. For any $x\in X\setminus \mathbb Q$ and $n<\omega$ some neighbourhood of $x$ is contained in $\{x\}\cup\{q_k:k>4n\}\subset f^{-1}((-\frac1n,\frac1n))$, hence $f$ is also continuous at $x$.

The closure $A=\text{cl}(f^{-1}((0,+\infty)))$ contains $x=\lim_{n\to\infty} q_{4n}$ but does not
contain the isolated points $\{q_{4n+2}:n<\omega\}$.
Hence $x$ does not belong to the interior of $A$ and $A$ is not open.
