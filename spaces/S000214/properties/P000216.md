Since $\mathbb Z\cong$ {S2|P30},
the lexicographic product $\mathbb Z^{\omega_1}$ is {P30}
by Theorem 4.2.2 in {{zb:0282.54017}} (accessible [here](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/12753)).
By Theorem 2.4.7 therein and the fact that {S214|P86}, it suffices to prove that $X\setminus\{\mathbf 0\}$
is {P30}, where $\mathbf 0\in X$ denotes the element with all coordinates $0$.

Observe that  $X\setminus\{\mathbf0\}$ is the disjoint union of the open order-convex sets
$U_{\lambda,n}=\{0\}^{\lambda}\times\{n\}\times\mathbb Z^{(\lambda,\omega_1)}$ for $\lambda<\omega_1$ and $n\in\mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}$.
Each of these subspaces is order-isomorphic and homeomorphic to $X$, hence {P30}.
Consequently, so is $X\setminus\{\mathbf0\}$.
