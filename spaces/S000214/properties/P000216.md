Since $\mathbb Z\cong$ {S2|P30},
the lexicographic product $\mathbb Z^{\omega_1}$ is paracompact
by Theorem 4.2.2 in {{zb:0282.54017}}.
By Theorem 2.3.7 therein, it suffices to prove that $X\setminus\{0\}$
is {P30} ({S214|P86}).
Observe that  $X\setminus\{0\}$ is a disjoint union of lexicographic
products, namely
$(0,\rightarrow)_X=\bigcup_{\lambda<\omega_1} \{0\}^{\lambda}\times\{n\in\mathbb Z: n>0\}\times \mathbb Z^{(\lambda,\omega_1)}$,
which are {P30} by the same argument as $X$.
