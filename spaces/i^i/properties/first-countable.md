Let $x\in I^I$ and let $\mathcal{B}$ be a countable collection of open neighborhoods of $x$.  Since each neighborhood is allowed to be a proper subset of $I$ in only finitely many coordinates, it follows that there are only countably many coordinates where some element of $\mathcal{B}$ misses a point of $I$ in that coordinate.  Let $j$ be a coordinate where this does not happen.  Such a $j$ is guaranteed to exist since there are uncountably many coordinates.  Then let $a < x_j < b$ be such that not both of $a=0$ and $b=1$ are true.  (Also, we must allow for $a=x_j$ or $b=x_j$ in the cases where $x_j=0$ or $x_j=1$ respectively.)  Then the open set $U$ which is $I$ in every coordinate $i\ne j$ but $(a,b)$ in the $j$-coordinate contains no element of $\mathcal{B}$, thus $\mathcal{B}$ cannot be a local basis at $x$.
