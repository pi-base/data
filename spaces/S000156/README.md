Let $X=\omega\cup\{\infty\}$ be the one-point compactification of a
countable discrete space. Arens space $S_2$ is the minimal topology
on $(X\times\omega)\cup\{\infty'\}$ where
$(\{\infty\}\times\omega)\cup\{\infty'\}$ is homeomorphic to $X$.

This space was originally defined by Richard Arens in {{mr:0037500}}.

The subspace $(\omega\times\omega)\cup\{\infty'\}$ of the Arens space is homeomorphic to {S23}, as mentioned in Examples 2.10 and 3.10 of {{mr:3269014}}.
