$A$ is a closed subset which does not include $(0,1)$. If $U$ is an open neighborhood of $(0,1)$, and $V \supset A$ is open, then there is a $b > 0$ such that $\{ (x,1) : 0 \leq x < b \} \subseteq U$. As $( \frac{b}{2} , 0 ) \in V$ there is an $a < \frac{b}{2}$ such that $\{ (x,0) : a < x \leq \frac{b}{2} \} \cup \{ (x,1) : a < x < \frac{b}{2} \} \subseteq V$. But then $(x,1) \in U \cap V$ for all $a < x < \frac{b}{2}$.
