Player 2 has the following winning strategy:

For every $n<\omega$ it is enough to pick $V_n:=[x_n,y_n)$, where $[x_n,y_n]\subset U_n$, $y_n>x_n$.

Then $\bigcap_{n=0}^\infty U_n \supset \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty [x_n,y_n]$, which is nonempty
as a nested intersection of nonempty compact sets in the Euclidean topology.
