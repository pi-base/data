{S46|P90}, hence is {P42}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Alexandrov%2B%7ELocally+path+connected).

Now given any open path connected set $V\subseteq X$ (from a base of such sets),
$V$ contains all the points of $X$ topologically indistinguishable from any of its points.
Using the fact that every point has $\mathfrak c$ many points topologically indistinguishable from it,
one can construct an injective path in $V$ between any two distinct points of $V$, as shown in {{mathse:5006475}}.
