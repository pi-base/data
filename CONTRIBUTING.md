## How to Contribute

You'll need to log in or [join GitHub](https://www.github.com/join/) to contribute.

### Open an Issue

The easiest way to suggest an improvement is to [open an Issue](https://github.com/pi-base/data/issues).
Include the following information:

- All spaces/properties/theorems related to your improvement, including their IDs (e.g. S012345).
  Links to <https://topology.pi-base.org> are encouraged.
- A description of the changes you'd recommend.

After discussion of your suggestion, any contributor can make a Pull Request (see below) to implement your improvement. 

### Make a Pull Request

To add a pull request implementing any changes to the repository, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/)
this project to your own account, make whatever changes you'd like, then
[open up all pull request for review](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
Be sure to review [our conventions](https://github.com/pi-base/data#conventions) on notation and naming.

In the near future, we will provide a way to automatically preview the results of pull requests at
<https://topology.pi-base.org>. For now, you are welcome to open a pull request and ask a reviewer to
set up this preview for you.

Our reviewers will check to make sure that PRs are properly sourced, and either suggest changes or
merge them into master.

## References

Ideally, contributions should reference a peer-reviewed publication, along with a Mathematical Reviews link
or DOI link. Sometimes Wikipedia references are also appropriate.

To contribute improvements not directly reflected in the literature, we encourage you to ask (and self-answer)
an appropriate question on either <https://math.stackexchange.com/> or <https://mathoverflow.net/>,
and use that as your citation.
