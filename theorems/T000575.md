Let $X$ be almost discrete.  Every subspace of $X$ is either almost discrete or discrete.
Thus every subspace of $X$ is {P146}:
- For {P203} subspaces: {T574}.
- For {P52} subspaces, [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Discrete+%2B+%7EUltraparacompact).

The result then follows, since every {P146} space is {P88}
