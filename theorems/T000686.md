This is the Michael-Nagami theorem.

According to Theorem 5.3.3 of {{zb:0684.54001}} (which assumes {P3} for all notions in that chapter),
spaces that are {P31}, {P88} and {P3} are {P30}.
By passing to the Kolmogorov quotient, one obtains that 
{P31} {P88} {P134} spaces are {P30}.

Now {P88} implies {P13}.
And for {P13} spaces, the properties {P135}, {P134} and {P11} are equivalent
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Normal%2B%24R_1%24%2B%7ERegular).
So one can equivalently formulate the theorem with the {P11} property.

OPEN QUESTION: Is the {P11} hypothesis needed?
