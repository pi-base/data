Suppose the sequence of open covers $\mathscr U_1,\mathscr U_2,\dots$
is a development for $X$.  For each $x\in X$, the collection
$\{\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n):n=1,2,\dots\}$ is a local base at $x$.
Since $X$ is {P1}, it is also {P2}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Developable%2B%24T_0%24%2B%7E%24T_1%24).
Therefore, $\bigcap_n\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)=\{x\}$.
