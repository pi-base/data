Given two distinct points $a,b\in X$, by {P1} there is an open set $U$
containing one of the points and not the other, say $a\in U$ and $b\notin U$.
By {P50} there is a clopen set $V$ with $a\in V\subseteq U$.
Then $V$ is a clopen set containing $a$ and not $b$;
and $X\setminus V$ is a clopen set containing $b$ and not $a$.
