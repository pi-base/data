Let $A \subseteq X$ be sequentially closed and $x \in X \setminus A$. It suffices to show $d(x,A)>0$. Assume to the contrary that $d(x,A)=0$. Then there exists a sequence of elements $a_n$ of $A$ s.t. $d(x,a_n)\to 0$. It is easy to see that this implies $a_n \to x$, so as $A$ is sequentially closed, we have $x \in A$, a contradiction.
