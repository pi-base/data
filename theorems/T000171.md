If there is a point $x\in X$ that has an open neighborhood $U$ homeomorphic to
$\mathbb R^n$ with $n\ge 1$, the open set $U$ contains two disjoint
nonempty open sets, themselves open in $X$.  Otherwise, every point is isolated;
so two distinct points are contained in two disjoint nonempty open sets.
