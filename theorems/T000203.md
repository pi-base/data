Given a {P41} {P154} $X$, there is a base for the topology consisting of {P36} open sets. Each of these open sets $U$ is itself a {P154} (as a subspace of a {P154}), hence is a {P133} by {T131}. {{mathse:4968515}} shows that a {P36} {P133} is {P23}. So $U$ is {P23} and the same holds for $X$. See also {{mathse:4968678}}.
