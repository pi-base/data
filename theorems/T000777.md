By taking Kolmogorov quotient we can assume $X$ is {P3}. Assume $X$ is not {P221}. Since $X$ is {P207}, the neighbourhoods of the diagonal $\Delta_X\subseteq X\times X$ form a uniformity $\mathcal{U}$ on $X$. Equip $X$ with this uniformity and let $(x_i)_{i\in I}$ be a Cauchy net on $X$ that isn't convergent. Since a Cauchy net converges to each of its adherence points, for each $x\in X$ there exists a neighbourhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $x_i\notin U_x$ for large enough $i$. From theorem 5.28 of {{mr:370454}}, the open cover $\{U_x : x\in X\}$ is even, so there exists $V\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $V[x] = \{y\in X :(x, y)\in V\}$ is contained in $U_z$ for some $z\in X$. If $i_0$ is such that $(x_j, x_k)\in V$ for $j, k\geq i_0$, then $(x_{i_0}, x_i)\in V$ for all $i\geq i_0$, so $x_i\in V[x_{i_0}]\subseteq U_z$ for all $i\geq i_0$. This is a contradiction since $x_i\notin U_z$ for big enough $i$.
