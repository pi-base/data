Let $U$ be a connected open subset of $X$ with $|U|\geq 2$. Since $X\setminus U$ is {P208} and so {P41}, 
we can write it as a union of finitely many connected sets $F_1, ..., F_n$.
If any of these sets has size $|F_k|\geq 2$ then $X$ is not {P44} so we can assume $X\setminus U$ is finite.
Since $X$ is locally connected, it follows that for every $x\in X$, either each of its neighbourhoods is cofinite, or $x$ is isolated.
Let $Y$ be the set of all isolated points of $X$. Then $Y$ is compact and discrete, hence finite. Then $X\setminus Y$ is biconnected so we can take it instead of $X$.
Write $X = X_1\cup X_2$ where $|X_1| = |X_2|$, then $X_1, X_2$ are connected since every neighbourhood of these spaces is cofinite. Contradiction.
