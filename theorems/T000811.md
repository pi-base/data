Assume by contradiction that $X$ is biconnected. If $Y$ is the set of isolated points of $X$, then $Y$ is discrete and compact and so finite.

If $x\notin X\setminus Y$ and $x\in V$ is open, then there exists a connected neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ with $U\subseteq V$. Necessarily $|U|\geq 2$.

Since $X\setminus U$ is Noetherian, it is locally connected, and so there exist connected $F_1, ..., F_n$ (open in $X\setminus U$), such that $X\setminus U = F_1\cup ...\cup F_n$.

If it were $|F_k|\geq 2$ for some $k$, then $U, F_k$ would be disjoint connected subsets of $X$ having $\geq 2$ points, which contradicts that $X$ is biconnected.

So $|F_k| = 1$ for all $k$ so that $X\setminus V\subseteq X\setminus U$ is finite. Take infinite disjoint $X_1, X_2\subseteq X\setminus Y$. 

Then every $x\in X_i$ has only cofinite neighbourhoods in $X_i$, and so $X_i$ is anti-Hausdorff, therefore connected. 

Then $X$ contains two disjoint connected sets, which is a contradiction since $X$ is biconnected.
