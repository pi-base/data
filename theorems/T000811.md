Since $X$ is {P41} (using {T651}), hence every connected component of $X$ is open.
By {P16} $X$ has finitely many connected components.
One of these connected components is infinite.

Now choose two disjoint infinite sets $X_1,X_2\subseteq X$.
Each $X_i$ is {P208},
and therefore contains an infinite connected set.
So $X$ contains two disjoint connected sets, each of size at least $2$,
showing that $X$ is not {P44}.
