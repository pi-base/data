Since the space $X$ is nonempty and {P24}, it has a nonempty closed {P16} subset $Y$.
Now, as $Y$ is compact, any chain of nonempty closed subsets of $Y$ has nonempty intersection. Thus, by Zorn's lemma, there is a minimal nonempty closed subset $A$ of $Y$. Since $Y$ is closed in $X$, so is $A$, and thus $A$ is a minimal nonempty closed subset of $X$. As $X$ is {P1}, it is easy to see that $A$ must be a singleton.
