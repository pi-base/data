If $A_1, A_2$ are disjoint closed sets, from Urysohn lemma there exist disjoint zero-sets $Z_1, Z_2$ such that $A_1\subseteq Z_1$ and $A_2\subseteq Z_2$. Since $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional there exist disjoint clopen sets $U_1, U_2$ with $Z_1\subseteq U_1$ and $Z_2\subseteq U_2$. It follows that $A_1\subseteq U_1, A_2\subseteq U_2$ so that $X$ is ultranormal.
