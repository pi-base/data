Let $M$ be a {P16} {P199} $n$-manifold.
Since {P199} spaces are {P36}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Contractible%2B%7EConnected),
$M$ is a connected closed $n$-manifold
(where "closed manifold" here means a "compact manifold without boundary";
see {{wikipedia:Closed_manifold}}).
It follows from the remark after Theorem 3.26 in the Poincar√© duality section of {{zb:1044.55001}} that $H_n(M; \mathbb Z_2) = \mathbb Z_2$.

But since $M$ is {P199}, we have $H_n(M; \mathbb Z_2) = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$.
This forces $n = 0$ and therefore $M$ is {S162}.
