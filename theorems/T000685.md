See {{mathse:418509}}.

Specifically, let $M$ be a {P16} {P199} $n$-manifold. Then $M$ is a {P36} closed $n$-manifold.
It follow from the remark under Theorem 3.26 in {{zb:1044.55001}} that $H_n(M; \mathbb Z_2) = \mathbb Z_2$.

But since $M$ is {P199}, we have $H_n(M; \mathbb Z_2) = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$.
This forces $n = 0$ and therefore $M$ is {S162}.
