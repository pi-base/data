Suppose that $\mathcal{U} = (U_i)_{i\in I}$ is a family of open subsets of $X$ covering $Y$. Find open $V_n$ such that $X\setminus \bigcup_i U_i = \bigcap_n V_n$. For each $n$ take a partition of unity $\{f_{i, n} : i\in I\}\cup \{g_n\}$ subordinate to $\mathcal{U}\cup \{V_n\}$. Consider $f_i = \sum_n 2^{-n}f_{i, n}$ and $g = \sum_n 2^{-n} g_n$. Then $f_i$ and $g$ are continuous and $\sum_i f_i = 1-g$. If $x\in Y$ then $x\notin U_n$ for some $n$ so $g_n(x) = 0$ so $1-g(x) \geq 2^{-n}> 0$. It follows that $1-g > 0$ on $Y$, and so the functions $h_i$ defined as $h_i(x) = \frac{f_i(x)}{1-g(x)}$ for $x\in Y$ form a partition of unity on $Y$ subordinate to $\mathcal{U}$.
