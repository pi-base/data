Suppose $X$ satisfies the hypotheses.
Given an open neighborhood $U$ of a point $p$, there is a continuous map $f:X\to[0,1]$ such that $f(p)=0$ and $f(x)=1$ outside of $U$.
The set $V=\{x\in X:f(x)<1/2\}$ is a cozero set with $p\in V\subseteq\overline V\subseteq U$.
Its closure $\overline V$ is a clopen neighborhood of $p$ contained in $U$.
