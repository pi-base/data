Assume to the contrary that $X$ is not {P202}. The intersection of $\overline{\{x\}}$
for all $x \in X$ coincides with the intersection of all nonempty closed sets, so it is the set of all focal points of $X$,
whence empty by assumption. Thus, $\{\overline{\{x\}}^c: x \in X\}$ is an open cover of $X$. As $X$ is {P193}, there
is an open cover $\{V_x\}_{x \in X}$ of $X$ s.t. $\overline{V_x} \subseteq \overline{\{x\}}^c$ for all $x$. Now, fix $x_0 \in X$.
There exists $x \in X$ s.t. $x_0 \in V_x \subseteq \overline{V_x} \subseteq \overline{\{x\}}^c$.
Then $\overline{V_x}$ and $\overline{\{x\}}$ are nonempty disjoint closed sets,
which contradicts $X$ being {P40}.
