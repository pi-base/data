Up to homeomorphism, there are exactly 8 spaces that are {P133} and {P37}
(see {{mathse:4965665}}).
Five of them are {P200} because they are {P199} or {P129}
(see [here](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=LOTS%2BPath+connected%2B%28Contractible%7CIndiscrete%29)).
The remaining three are shown to be {P200} by a direct argument
(see [here](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=LOTS%2BPath+connected%2B%7EContractible%2B%7EIndiscrete%2BSimply+connected)).
