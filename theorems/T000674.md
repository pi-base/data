$X$ is $T_1$.

For the monotone normality operator $\mu(x,U)$ for $x\in U$ with $U$ open,
one can choose $\mu(x,U)=\{x\}$ if $x$ is an isolated point of $X$
and $\mu(x,U)=U$ if $x$ is the non-isolated point,
as suggested in the comment to {{mo:313089}}.
It is easy to check that this satisfies Definition 2 of {P109}.
