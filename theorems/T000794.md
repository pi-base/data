For each $x \in X$, take an open neighborhood $U$ that is {P133}. Since $X$ is {P47}, $U$ is {P47} and thus {P50} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=LOTS+%2B+Totally+disconnected+%2B+%7EZero+dimensional), hence $X$ is locally {P50}.

A {P11} locally {P50} space is {P50}, see for example Proposition 4.14 of {{mr:3193090}}.
