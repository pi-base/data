By {{mathse:5016854}}, an almost discrete space that is not semiregular must be
the disjoint union of the {S10} and a {P52} space.

The {S10|P94}, {P52} implies locally finite [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Discrete+%2B+%7ELocally+finite),
and the disjoint union of two locally finite spaces is itself locally finite.
