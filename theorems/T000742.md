Since $X$ is {P112}, there exists a continuous bijection $f:X\to Y$ where $Y$ is a {P53} space. Necessarily $Y$ has {P164}.
Every {P53} space is {P7} and {P194}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Metrizable%2B%7ESubmetacompact).
So every subspace of $Y$ satisfies the hypotheses of {T382},
and hence is {P162}.
By Corollary 8.18 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}
every subspace of $X$ is {P162}.
