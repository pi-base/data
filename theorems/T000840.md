Let $A \subseteq X$ be sequentially closed, we show $X \setminus A$ is open. By {P228},
we need to show that for all $x \in X \setminus A$, there is a $m \in \mathbb{N}$, such that $V_m(x)\subseteq X \setminus A$.
If this were not the case, picking $x_n \in V_n(x) \cap A$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ gives a sequence $x_1,x_2,\dots$ converging to $x$, contradicting $A$ being sequentially closed.
