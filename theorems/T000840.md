Suppose $A\subseteq X$ is not a closed set.
Then $A^c=X\setminus A$ is not open and by the {P228} property
there is some $x\in A^c$ such that $A^c$ does not contain any $V_n(x)$, that is, every $V_n(x)$ meets $A$.
Choose $x_n\in V_n(x)\cap A$ for each $n$.
The sequence $x_1,x_2,\dots$ converges to $x$,
since every neighborhood of $x$ contains all $V_n(x)$ for $n$ sufficiently large.
Thus $A$ is not sequentially closed.
