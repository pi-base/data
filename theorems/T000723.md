Suppose $X$ is {P99} and not {P46},
so there is a non-constant path $\gamma:[0,1]\to X$.
The image $A=\gamma([0,1])$ is {P37} and {P99} and has multiple points.
Therefore $A$ is not {P44}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Path+connected%2BUS%2BHas+multiple+points%2BBiconnected).
Since the {P44} property is preserved by connected sets,
$X$ is not {P44} either.
