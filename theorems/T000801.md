Let $\mathcal B$ be a countable base for the topology of $X$.
For each $U\in\mathcal B$ and $x\in U$, we have $\overline{\{x\}}\subseteq U$ by the {P135} property.
So $\mathscr U_{U,x}:=\{U,X\setminus\overline{\{x\}}\}$ is an open cover of $X$
and satisfies $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr{U})=U$.
Therefore the $\mathscr U_{U,x}$, of which there are countably many, form a development for $X$.
