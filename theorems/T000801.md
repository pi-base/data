Choose a countable basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $X$. For $x \in X$, let $\mathcal{B}_x := \{U \in \mathcal{B}: x \in U\}$ the corresponding neighborhood basis of $x$. As $X$ is countable, so is $\{(x,U): x \in X, U \in \mathcal{B}_x\}$, so it suffices to show that for all $x \in X$ and $U \in \mathcal{B}_x$, there is an open cover $\mathscr{U}$ of $X$, such that $\{V\in\mathscr{U}:x\in V\} = \{U\}$ and therefore 
\[ \operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr{U})=\bigcup\{V\in\mathscr{U}:x\in V\} = U. \]

As $X$ is $R_0$, for all from $x$ distinguishable $y \in X$, we find an open neighborhood $U_y$ of $y$ such that $x \notin U_y$. Then $\mathscr{U} := \{U\} \cup \{U_y:y \in X \text{ is distinguishable from } x\}$ is an open cover satisfying the desired property.
