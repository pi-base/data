Let $X$ be a connected linearly ordered topological space with countable dense subset $Q$.
Then the collection of all open intervals and rays of the form $(p, q)$ with $p,q\in Q\cup \{-\infty, \infty\}$ forms a countable base for $X$.
To see this, let $x\in(a,b)$ - as $X$ is connected if either of $(a,x)$ or $(x,b)$ is empty then $x$ is the minimum (resp maximum) value of $X$, so choose $p\in(a,x)\cap Q$ and $q\in(x,b)\cap Q$ if they are nonempty, otherwise choose $p=-\infty$ or $q=\infty$ as necessary.
