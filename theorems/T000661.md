Given a discrete family $(F_i)_{i \in I}$  of nonempty closed sets in $X$,
take a point $x_i\in F_i$ for each $i$.
The subspace $\{x_i:i\in I\}$ is discrete,
hence countable because $X$ is {P197}.

So there are only countably many $F_i$,
and one can find a disjoint open expansion of $(F_i)_i$ by Theorem 2.1.14 of {{zb:0684.54001}}.
