Suppose $X$ is {P217} and suppose that $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ is a non-constant continuous function, say $f(x)\neq f(y)$. Then $Z_1 = f^{-1}(f(x))$ and $Z_2 = f^{-1}(f(y))$ are disjoint non-empty zero-sets, and so there exists a clopen set $U$ with $Z_1\subseteq U$ and $Z_2\cap U=\empty$. Since $U$ is a non-empty proper subset of $X$, $X$ is not {P36}.
