Let $A \subset X$ be countably infinite. If $A \subset X$ has no limit point then it must be closed. Moreover, for every $a \in A$ there is some open $U_a \subset X$ such that $U_a \cap A = \{a\}$. Then the set of all $U_a$ together with $X \setminus A$ forms a countable cover of $X$ and must have some finite subcover. Thus $A$ may be covered by finitely many $U_a$, contradicting the fact that $A$ is infinite. Thus $A$ must have a limit point.
