The $\Sigma$-product

$\quad Y=\{x=(x_\alpha)\in\mathbb R^\Gamma:\{\alpha:x_\alpha\ne 0\}\text{ is countable}\}$

for some set $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of the topological group $(\mathbb R^\Gamma,+)$
with the product topology, and is {P187}
since {S25|P187}
and the {P187} property is preserved by $\Sigma$-products.
