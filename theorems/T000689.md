By the known theorem {P57} ∧ {P121} ∧ {P36} ⇒ {P129}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Countable+%2B+Pseudometrizable+%2B+Connected+%2B+%7EIndiscrete),
each subset of a space that is countable, pseudometrizable, and connected is indiscrete.
Thus, a space with such an open neighborhood of every point has a cover by
indiscrete open sets, i.e. the space has a {P185}.
