The space $X$ is {P36} by definition of {P45}.  If $X=A\cup B$ with $A$ and $B$ disjoint and connected of size at least $2$ and if the dispersion point $p$ of $X$ is in $A$ for example, then $B$ would be a connected subset of $X\setminus\{p\}$ of size at least $2$.  That is not possible since $X\setminus\{p\}$ is {P47}.
