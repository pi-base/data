If $A_1, A_2$ are closed and disjoint, then $\mathcal{U} = \{X\setminus A_1, X\setminus A_2\}$ is an open cover of $X$ so it has a refinement to an open cover $\mathcal{V} = \{V_1, V_2\}$ where $V_1, V_2$ are disjoint. Then $A_1\subseteq V_2, A_2\subseteq V_1$ and $V_1, V_2$ are clopen and disjoint.
