According to Theorem 1 in {{zb:1400.39025}}, there are three types of connected door spaces:
- an *excluded point topology* (like {S12}),
which is almost discrete;
- a *particular point topology* (like {S8}),
which is hyperconnected;
- a *free ultrafilter topology* (like {S145}),
which is hyperconnected.

So, if a connected door space is not almost discrete, it must be hyperconnected.
