Let $d$ be a metric, and define $\mathcal{U}_0 = \{X\}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{n+1}$ to be open partition which is a refinement of $\{B_d(x, \frac{1}{n})\cap U : x\in X, U\in\mathcal{U}_n\}$. Define $\delta(x, y) = \inf\{1/n : \exists_U\ \{x, y\}\subseteq U\in \mathcal{U}_n\}$.

- (1) $\delta(x, y) = 0$ iff $x = y$

  If $x = y$, then there is unique $U_n\in \mathcal{U}_n$ such that $x\in U_n$, and so $\delta(x, y) = 0$. Conversely, if $\delta(x, y) = 0$, then there are $U_n\in \mathcal{U}_n$ such that $\{x, y\}\subseteq U_n$ for all $n$. Then $\text{diam } \{x, y\} \leq \text{diam } U_{n+1} \leq 2/n$ and so $x = y$.

- (2) $\delta(x, y) = \delta(y, x)$

  Clear from definition.

- (3) $\delta(x, z)\leq \max(\delta(x, y), \delta(y, z))$

  If $\delta(x, z)> \max(\delta(x, y), \delta(y, z))$ then there exists $n$ such that $\{x, y\}\subseteq V$ and $\{y, z\}\subseteq U$ for some $V, U\in \mathcal{U}_n$ and $\{x, z\}$ is not contained in an element of $\mathcal{U}_n$. Since $\mathcal{U}_n$ is a partition and $y\in U\cap V$ it follows that $U = V$ and so $\{x, z\}\subseteq U$, which is a contradiction.

- (4) $\delta$ and $d$ induce the same topology on $X$

  Let $x\in X$ and $r > 0$ be given. Observe that $B_\delta(x, \frac{1}{n}) = U$ where $U\in \mathcal{U}_{n+1}$ is the unique element in the partition containing $x$. Then $B_\delta(x, r) = B_\delta(x, \frac{1}{n})$ or $B_\delta(x, r) = X$ and so $B_\delta(x, r)$ is open, so there is $s > 0$ such that $B_d(x, s)\subseteq B_\delta(x, r)$. And since $\text{diam }U \leq \frac{2}{n+1}$ for $U\in\mathcal{U}_{n+1}$, there is $n$ such that $B_\delta(x, \frac{1}{n})\subseteq B_d(x, r)$. And so the metrics $d, \delta$ are topologically equivalent.

Since $\delta$ is an ultrametric, it follows that $X$ is ultrametrizable.
