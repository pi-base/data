Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a continuous bijection from a {P19} space $X$ to a {P53} space $Y$.

Let $A \subseteq X$ be closed.
Since closed subspaces and continuous images of a {P19} space are {P19}, $f(A)$ is {P19}.
Since $Y$ is {P53}, it is {P103} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Metrizable+%2B+%7EStrongly+KC), and hence $f(A)$ is closed in $Y$.

Therefore, $f$ is a closed map and $f$ is a homeomorphism, which implies $X$ itself is {P53}.
