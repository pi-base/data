Excercise 6.3.2 (f) in {{zb:0684.54001}}.
Using the fact that {P217} and {P53}
 imply {P146} ([[explore]](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=metrizable%2BStrongly+zero-dimensional%2B~ultraparacompact))
one inductively constructs a sequence $\mathscr U_n$ of clopen partitions such that
- $\mathscr U_{n+1}$ is a refinement of $\mathscr U_{n}$ (with $\mathscr U_0=\{X\}$),
- the diameter of each member of $\mathscr U_n$ is not greater than $2^{-n}$,
- a linear order on $\mathscr U_{n+1}$ is given such that
  + every member of $\mathscr U_{n+1}$ has its successor and predecessor (unless it is the minimal or maximal element);
  + for each $V\in \mathscr U_n$ the set $\{ U\in\mathscr U_{n+1}: U\subseteq V\}$ is a closed interval in $\mathscr U_{n+1}$.

Then for each $x\in X$ we have a sequence $\{U_n\}_{n<\omega}$ such that $x\in U_n\in\mathscr U_n$ and a linear order on $X$ can be defined based on the lexicographic order on $\prod_{n<\omega} \mathscr U_n$
(decides the comparison on the first coordinate the associated sequences differ).
