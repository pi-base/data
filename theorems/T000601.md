  name: Is a path-connected space with a dispersion point necessarily contractible?
---

By assumption, there exists a point $p \in X$ whose only neighborhood is $X$. We argue that $F : X \times [0, 1] \to X$, defined by $$F(x, t) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if }t < 1\\ p & \text{if }t = 1\end{cases}$$ is continuous, hence is a homotopy between the identity map of $X$ and a constant map. Suppose $A \subset X$ is open. If $p \in A$, then $A = X$ and $F^{-1}(A) = X \times [0, 1]$. Otherwise, if $p \notin A$, then $F^{-1}(A) = A \times [0,1)$. Since $F^{-1}(A)$ is open in both cases, it follows that $F$ is continuous.

This construction appears at the end of David Gao's answer to {{mathse:4993007}}. This also appears as Lemma 2.3.2 in Peter May's [Finite spaces and larger contexts](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/FINITE/FINITEBOOK/FINITEBOOKCollatedDraft.pdf).
