First assume $X$ is nonempty and show it has an isolated point.  Take a nonempty finite open set $U\subseteq X$ that is minimal under inclusion.  It cannot contain more than one point, otherwise intersecting with another open set that contains one point and not another in $U$ would give a strictly smaller open set, which is not possible.  So $U$ consists of one isolated point.

Now given any nonempty subspace $A\subseteq X$, it is itself locally finite and $T_0$ and hence contains a point isolated in $A$.  This shows that $X$ is scattered.
