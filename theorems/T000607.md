Suppose $X$ satisfies the hypotheses, and let $p$ be the non-isolated point of $X$.

Let $A$ be a {P19} subset of $X$.
If $p\in A$, the set $A$ is closed.
If $p\notin A$, the set $A$ is {P52}, hence {P78} 
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Discrete%2BCountably+compact%2B%7EFinite).
Since $X$ is {P2}, the set $A$ is also closed in this case.
