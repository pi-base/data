Follows from {{mathse:4969398}} ({P134} and {P30} imply {P11}), {{zb:0684.54001}} Theorem 5.1.5 ({P30} and {P11} imply {P13}) and {{mathse:4862626}} ({P13} and {P30} imply {P34}).

Note that while {{zb:0684.54001}} defines paracompact spaces to be {P3}, neither {P3} nor even {P2} are required to upgrade from {P11} to {P13} in the second half of the proof of Theorem 5.1.5.
