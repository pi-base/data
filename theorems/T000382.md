By theorem in the article {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1973-0322812-9}}, if $X$ is $T_4$, embeds as a closed subspace of product of $\theta$-refinable spaces, and every closed discrete subspace of $X$ is realcompact (equivalently, of cardinality smaller than the first measurable cardinal, see {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}} theorem 12.2), then $X$ is realcompact. If $X$ is already $\theta$-refinable, then it's itself a product of $\theta$-refinable spaces in which it embeds as a closed subspace.
