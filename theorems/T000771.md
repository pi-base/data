Let $d$ be an ultrametric on $X$. Note that if $x, y\in X$ and $a\in A\subseteq X$, then $d(x, a)\leq \max(d(x, y), d(y, a))$ and so by taking infimum over $A$, we have $d(x, A)\leq \max(d(x, y), d(y, A)).$

Suppose $r = d(x, A) > 0$, and let $d(x, y) < r$. Then $d(x, A)\leq \max(d(x,y), d(y, A)) = d(y, A)$ and $d(y, A)\leq \max(d(x, y), d(x, A)) = d(x, A)$ so that $d(y, A) = d(x, A)$.

If now $A, B$ are non-empty and closed, and $f:X\to [0, 1]$ is given by $f(x) = \frac{d(x, A)}{d(x, A)+d(x, B)}$, then $C = f^{-1}(1/2) = \{x\in X : d(x, A) = d(x, B)\}$ is closed and if $x\in C$, then $r = d(x, A) = d(x, B) > 0$ so that if $d(x, y) < r$ then $d(y, A) = d(x, A) = d(x, B) = d(y, B)$ so that $B(x, r)\subseteq C$. It follows that $C$ is clopen, and so $A\subseteq f^{-1}([0, 1/2))$ and $B\subseteq f^{-1}([1/2, 1])$ are disjoint clopen sets. So $X$ is ultranormal.
