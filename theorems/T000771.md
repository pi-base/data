If $d$ is an ultrametric on $X$, then $d(x, A)\leq \max(d(x, y), d(y, A))$. This implies that if $d(x, y) < d(x, A)$, then $d(x, A) = d(y, A)$.

We first show $X$ is {P218}.
Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty disjoint closed sets.
Define $f:X\to[0,1]$ by $f(x) := \frac{d(x, A)}{d(x, A)+d(x, B)}$.
The set $C = f^{-1}(1/2)$ is closed.
If $x\in C$, then $r := d(x, A) = d(x, B) > 0$ so that $d(x, y) < r$ implies $d(y, A) = d(x, A) = d(x, B) = d(y, B)$, and therefore $B(x, r)\subseteq C$.
It follows that $C$ is clopen, so that $A, B$ are contained in the disjoint clopen sets $f^{-1}([0, 1/2))$ and $f^{-1}((1/2, 1])$.

The result then follows since {P53} {P218} spaces are {P146}
