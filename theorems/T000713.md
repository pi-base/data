This is essentially one of Bing's metrization theorems.

Suppose $X$ satisfies the hypotheses.
Since {T711}, we can add {P135} to the hypotheses.

Passing to the Kolmogorov quotient, it is equivalent to show that
{P88} {P110} {P2} spaces are {P53}.
This is exactly Theorem 5.4.1 in {{zb:0684.54001}},
which assumes {P2} as part of the definition of {P88}.
