Assume $X$ is not {P197} and take discrete uncountable set $D\subseteq X$. For each $d\in D$ take open $U_d$ such that $U_d\cap D = \{d\}$. 
There exist closed sets $F_n\subseteq X$ such that $\bigcup_n F_n = \bigcup_{d\in D} U_d$. Since $D$ is uncountable, there exists $n$ such that $F_n\cap D$ is uncountable. Since $F_n\cap D$ is uncountable and discrete, there exists a limit point $x\in (F_n\cap D)' \subseteq F_n\subseteq \bigcup_{d\in D} U_d$, and so there exists $d\in D$ such that $x\in U_d$. But $U_d$ intersects only finitely many elements of $F_n\cap D$, which is impossible for a limit point in {P2} space.
