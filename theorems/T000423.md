Since $X$ is {P23}, 
for any two points $x, y\in X$ there exists compact sets $K_1, K_2$ such that $x \in \text{int}(K_1), y\in \text{int}(K_2)$, 
and so a compact set $K = K_1\cup K_2$ such that $x, y\in \text{int}(K)$. 
Since $X$ is {P170}, $K$ is Hausdorff, and so $\text{int}(K)$ is Hausdorff.
It follows that $X$ can be covered by Hausdorff open sets $U_i$ such that for any $x, y\in X$ we can find $i$ with $x, y\in U_i$.
So there exist open disjoint $U, V\subseteq U_i$ such that $x\in U, y\in V$ open in $U_i$ and hence in $X$. Compare with {{mathse:5113190}}.
