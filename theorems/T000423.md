---

Given distinct points $x , y \in X$, each has a compact neighborhood. 
The union of these two neighborhoods is a compact set $K$ containing $x$ and $y$ in its interior. 
Since $X$ is {P170}, $K$ is Hausdorff, and so is $\text{int}(K)$, which is open in $X$. 
The points $x$ and $y$ can be separated by open sets in $\text{int}(K)$, which are necessarily open sets in $X$. See also {{mathse:5113190}}.
