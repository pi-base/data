Since $X$ is {P23}, for any two points $x, y\in X$ there exists compact $K$ such that $x, y\in \text{int}(K)$. 
Since $X$ is {P170}, $K$ is Hausdorff, and so $\text{int}(K)$ is Hausdorff.
It follows that $X$ can be covered by Hausdorff open sets $U_i$ such that for any $x, y\in X$ we can find $i$ with $x, y\in U_i$.
From discussion in {{mathse:5113190}} it follows that $X$ is Hausdorff.
