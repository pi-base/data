Suppose by contradiction that $A$ is an infinite compact subset of $X$.  Write $A=B\cup C$ with $B,C$ infinite and disjoint.
Because $X$ is {P39}, it is not possible that each of $B$ and $C$ contains a nonempty open subset of $X$.
So at least one of the two sets, say $B$, has all its subsets closed in $X$ by the {P126} property.
Therefore $B$ has the discrete topology.  But $B$ is also closed in $A$, hence compact, which is not possible.
