If a point $x$ has at the same time an open neighborhood homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$ and an open neighborhood homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^m$ with $n\ne m$, their intersection would be homeomorphic to an open set in $\mathbb R^n$ and to an open set in $\mathbb R^m$.  But this is not possible by invariance of domain ({{wikipedia:Invariance_of_domain}}).  So the dimension $n$ at the point $x$ is completely determined by the point, and by definition of {P122} the set of points of a given dimension $n$ is open in $X$.  Since $X$ is {P36}, the dimension must be the same at every point.
