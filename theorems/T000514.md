If $X$ is {P192}, {P39}, and nonempty, it has a generic point $x$. 
One of the characterizations of the {P135} property is that for each point $z\in X$ the closure $\operatorname{cl}\{z\}$ is the set of points topologically indistinguishable from $z$.  So each point of $\operatorname{cl}\{x\}=X$ is topologically indistinguishable from $x$, and $X$ is {P129}.
