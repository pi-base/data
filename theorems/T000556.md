Any clopen partition of a {P36} space $X$ must include $X$, so to admit clopen refinements every open cover must include $X$.
Thus, the union of all open sets except for $X$ cannot equal $X$ (as that would be an open cover not containing $X$), so all points outside of that union have $X$ as their only neighborhood.
