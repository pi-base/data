If $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $X$, take a locally finite subcover $\mathcal{V} = (V_i)$. Because $X$ is normal, there exists an open cover $\mathcal{W} = (W_i)$ of $X$ such that $\overline{W_i}\subseteq V_i$. Since $X$ is ultranormal we can find clopen $Q_i$ such that $\overline{W}_i\subseteq Q_i\subseteq V_i$. Then $\mathcal{Q} = (Q_i)$ is a locally finite clopen refinement of $\mathcal{U}$.
