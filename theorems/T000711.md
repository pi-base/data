Let $x,y\in X$ and let $U$ be an open set such that $x\in U$ and $y\notin U$.
If $(\mathscr U_n)_{n\ge 1}$ is a development for $X$,
there is some $n$ such that $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)\subseteq U$,
and therefore $y\notin\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)$.
Thus no member of $\mathscr U_n$ contains both $x$ and $y$.
Any open set $V\in\mathscr U_n$ with $y\in V$ will then satisfy $x\notin V$.
