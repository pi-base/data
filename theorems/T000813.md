Let $K$ be a {P16} subset of $X$. Then $K$ is {P130} (since $X$ is {P170}), {P167} and {P51}.

If $K$ is {P52} then $K$ is {P78} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=16+%2B+52+%2B+%7E78).

Otherwise, let $x \in K$ be of Cantor–Bendixson rank $1$ (namely $x \in K' \setminus K''$).
Since $K$ is {P130}, there exists an {P203} {P16} neighborhood $L \subseteq K$ of $x$ such that $x$ is the only non-isolated point.

If $L$ is not finite, let $M$ be any {P181} subspace of $L$ including $x$.
Since $M$ is closed in $L$, $M$ is {P16}. However, this is impossible [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=181+%2B+16+%2B+167).
