Let $K$ be a {P16} subset of $X$. Then
$K$ is {P3} (since $X$ is {P170}),
and $K$ also {P167} and {P51}.
To show that $K$ is finite, without loss of generality we can assume that $X$ itself
is {P16}, {P3}, {P167} and {P51}
and show that $X$ is finite.

If every point of $X$ is isolated, $X$ is finite by compactness.
Otherwise, because $X$ is {P51}, choose $x \in X$ with Cantor–Bendixson rank $1$ (that is, $x\in X'\setminus X''$).
So $x$ is not isolated in $X$ and there is a neighbourhood $L$ of $x$
such that all point in $L\setminus\{x\}$ are isolated in $X$.
Since $X$ is {P11}, we can assume $L$ is closed in $X$.
The neighbourhood $L$ must be infinite,
because otherwise $x$ would be isolated.

Take a countably infinite set $M\subseteq L$ containing $x$.
Since $L$ is {P203}, $M$ is closed in $L$, hence closed in $X$ and compact.
And since $M$ is {P167} and {P16},
it is not {P181}

which is a contradiction.
