If $X$ is $T_3$, it is $T_2$.  So given distinct points $a,b\in X$, there are disjoint open $O_a$ and $O_b$ containing $a$ and $b$ respectively. Then $a \notin \operatorname{cl}(O_b)$ and by regularity there is an open $U$ containing $a$ with $\operatorname{cl}(U) \cap \operatorname{cl}(O_b) = \emptyset$.

(where T_3 means regular).
