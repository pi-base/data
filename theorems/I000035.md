If $f:X \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a continuous function with $f(a)=0$ and $f(B)=\{1\}$, then $f^{-1}([0,\frac{1}{3}))$ and $f^{-1}((\frac{2}{3},1])$ are disjoint open sets with disjoint closures containing $a$ and $B$ respectively.

Asserted in Figure 1 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}
(where T_3 means regular and T_{3.5} means completely regular).
