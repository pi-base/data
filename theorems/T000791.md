Since $X$ is {P5} and {P191}, there exist closed neighbourhoods $U_n$ of $x$ such that $\{x\} = \bigcap_n U_n$ and $U_{n+1}\subseteq U_n$. 
Take an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, then $(X\setminus U_n)$ is a countable open cover of the countably compact space $X\setminus U$ and so there exists $n$ such that $X\setminus U\subseteq X\setminus U_n$, and so $U_n\subseteq U$. It follows that $(U_n)$ is a countable neighbourhood basis for $x$.
