If $x\neq y$ then since $X$ is functionally Hausdorff there exist disjoint zero-sets $Z_1, Z_2$ such that $x\in Z_1$ and $y\in Z_2$. Since $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional there exist disjoint clopen sets $U_1, U_2$ such that $x\in Z_1\subseteq U_1$ and $y\in Z_2\subseteq U_2$, so $X$ is totally separated.
