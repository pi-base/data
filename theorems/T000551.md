  name: Why should the union of such a family of sets have cardinality $\aleph_1$?

By {P93} choose a countable open neighborhood of each point.  So $X$ can be covered by a family of countable sets, forming a chain under inclusion by {P196}.  And the union of a chain of countable sets has cardinality at most $\aleph_1$ (see {{mathse:342091}} for example).
