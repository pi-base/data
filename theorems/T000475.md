Shown in Lemma 6 of {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2014.06.014}}.
Note that while the article assumes spaces to be {P3}, each property can be easily seen to be preserved under the Kolmogorov quotient, and a {P1} proximal space is $T_2$ as a consequence of {T570} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Proximal%2B%24T_0%24%2B%7E%24T_2%24).
