Every clopen set in a topological space is a cozero set.
On the other hand, if $X$ is {P147}, since every zero set is an intersection of countably many open sets, every zero set is clopen, and so is every cozero set.
So given a cozero set $U$ in $X$, its complement $X\setminus U$ is also a cozero set,
and their union is obviously dense in $X$.
