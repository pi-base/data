Given a discrete family $(F_i)_{i \in I}$  of nonempty closed sets in $X$,
take a point $x_i\in F_i$ for each $i$.
Every singleton $\{x_i\}$ is closed and the subspace $Y=\{x_i:i\in I\}$ is discrete.
Therefore $Y$ is closed and discrete,
and hence countable because $X$ is {P198}.

So there are only countably many $F_i$,
and one can find a disjoint open expansion of $(F_i)_i$ by Theorem 2.1.14 of {{zb:0684.54001}}.
