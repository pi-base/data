Let $\mathscr U$ be an open cover of $X$.
There is a sequence $\left<\mathscr V_n : n \in \omega\right>$ of open covers where each $\mathscr V_n$ is a refinement of $\mathscr U$ and, for each $x \in X$, there is some $n$ with $\operatorname{ord}(x,\mathscr V_n)=1$, and hence $\operatorname{ord}(x,\mathscr V_n)$ is finite.
