It is a classical result that {P37} {P3} spaces are {P95}.
This is shown for example in Jeremy Brazas's
[expository note](https://www.wcupa.edu/sciences-mathematics/mathematics/jBrazas/documents/Constructing_arcs_from_paths_9-9-21.pdf)
referenced from {{mathse:4247643}}.
See also Corollary 31.6 in {{zb:1052.54001}}.

Now suppose $X$ is {P37} and {P143}.
Given two distinct points $x,y\in X$ and a path $f:[0,1]\to X$,
the image $f([0,1])$ is Hausdorff (for example from Lemma 1 in {{mathse:964546}}).
By the classical case above, there is an arc (homeomorphic embedding) from $x$ to $y$
within $f([0,1])$, which is also an arc in $X$.
