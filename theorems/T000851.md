For every point $x \in X$, there is an open neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$
which is homeomorphic to a {P133}. Each path-component of a {P133} is a {P36} subset of a {P133} and thus a {P133}. Thus each path component is {P229} ([Explore](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=LOTS+%2B+Path+connected+%2B+%7ESemilocally+simply+connected)). Thus $U_x$ is {P229} for all $x \in X$ and so $X$ is {P229}.
