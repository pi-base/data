We use the fact that {P133} + {P36} $\Rightarrow$ {P130},
which follows from the theorems {T522}, {T203} and {T246}.

Fix $x\in X$. By {P120} the point $x$ has
a neighbourhood that is {P133}, and by {P41}
it has a connected neighbourhood contained in the first one.
A connected subset of {P133} is orderable as well
and hence is {P130}.
Therefore $x$ has a local base of compact neighbourhoods.

See the proof of Lemma 3.1 b) in {{zb:1458.54023}}.
