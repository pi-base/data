Every countably infinite $A\subseteq X$ converges to any point $x\in X$ since every neighborhood of $x$ contains all but finitely many points of $A$. So with $S_1,S_2,\dots\subseteq X$, each converging to $x$ as in the definition of {P210}, the set $S := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} S_n$ will also converge to $x$ and satisfy the {P210} condition.
