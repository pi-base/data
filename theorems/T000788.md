Let $(\mathcal{U}_n)$ be development for $X$. Since {T730}, there exist a $\sigma$-locally finite closed refinement $\mathcal{V}_n$ of $\mathcal{U}_n$ for each $n$. Then $\mathcal{N} = \bigcup_n \mathcal{V}_n$ is $\sigma$-locally finite, and if $x\in W$ with $W$ open, then there is $n$ with $\text{St}(x, \mathcal{U}_n)\subseteq W$, and so $\text{St}(x, \mathcal{V}_n)\subseteq \text{St}(x, \mathcal{U}_n)\subseteq W$. Since $\mathcal{V}_n$ is a cover, it follows that there is $V\in\mathcal{V}_n$ with $x\in V\subseteq W$. So $\mathcal{N}$ is a $\sigma$-locally finite network.
