Asserted on page 34 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} for metrizable spaces.  The result extends to pseudometrizable spaces, since the Kolmogorov quotient of a pseudometrizable space is metrizable, and the quotient induces a bijection between topologies, which preserves the qualities of being an open cover and of being a star refinement.
