Player 1 can play the W-game at a point $x\in X$ by choosing $U_0=X$.
And at round $n$, if Player 2 chose $x_i\in U_i$ at round $i$ for $i=0,...,n-1$,
Player 1 can choose $U_n=(X\setminus\{x_0,\dots,x_{n-1}\})\cup\{x\}$,
which is an open neighborhood of $x$.

Each element $y\ne x$ can appear at most once in the sequence $(x_n)_n$.
From this, it follows that $x_n\to x$ and Player 1 wins.
