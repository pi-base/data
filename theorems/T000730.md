Let $\mathscr U_1,\mathscr U_2,\dots$ be a development for $X$.
Let $\mathscr U$ be an open cover of $X$.
Take $\mathscr V_n$ to be an open cover that is a common refinement of $\mathscr U$ and $\mathscr U_n$.
Given $x\in X$, take $U\in\mathscr U$ with $x\in U$.
By definition of development, there is some $n$ such that $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)\subseteq U$.
Then, $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr V_n)\subseteq\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)\subseteq U$.
