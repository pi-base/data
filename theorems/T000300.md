If $Z_1, Z_2$ are disjoint zero-sets, there exists a continuous $f:X\to [0, 1]$ such that $f^{-1}(0) = Z_1$ and $f^{-1}(1) = Z_2$ (see theorem 1.5.14 in {{zb:0684.54001}}). Since $|X| < \mathfrak{c}$ there exists $r\in (0, 1)$ such that $f^{-1}(r) = \emptyset$. Then $V = f^{-1}([0, r)) = f^{-1}([0, r])$ is a clopen set such that $Z_1\subseteq V$ and $Z_2\cap V = \emptyset$, so $X$ is {P217}.
