Suppose $X$ is {P43} and not {P52}.
There is at least one point with an {P38} neighborhood $V$ that is not a singleton.
Two distinct point in $V$ are joined by an injective path $f:[0,1]\to X$.
Then, $f([0,1/3])$ and $f([2/3,1])$ are disjoint connected sets, each of size at least $2$.
Thus $X$ is not {P44}.
