Suppose $X$ is {P43} and not {P52}.
There is at least one point with an {P38} neighborhood $V$ that is not a singleton.
Two distinct point in $V$ are joined by an arc, that is, by an injective path $f:[0,1]\to X$.
Then the images of disjoint intervals in $[0,1]$ are disjoint connected sets in $X$,
each with at least two points,
which is one of the characterizations to show that a space is not {P44}.
