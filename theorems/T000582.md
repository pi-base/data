Let $x$ be a point of $X$. $X$ is $T_2$ and there is a winning strategy for P1 at $x$. By Theorem 3.7 of {{doi:10.1016/0016-660X(76)90024-6}}, either $x$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set, or there exists an uncountable discrete subset $D \subseteq X$ such that $D \cup \{x\}$ is compact. As $X$ has countable spread, then $x$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set.
