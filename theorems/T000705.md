Given distinct points $a,b\in X$, there is an arc $f:[0,1]\to X$ joining $a$ to $b$.
The image $A=f([0,1])$ is homeomorphic to $[0,1]$.
So $a$ has an open neighborhood $V$ in $A$ not containing $b$.
Since $V=A\cap U$ for some open set $U$ in $X$,
$a$ has $U$ as neighborhood in $X$ not containing $b$.
