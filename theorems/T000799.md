Let $\mathscr V$ be a locally finite collection of subsets of $X$.
Then $\mathscr V$ must be finite.
The reason is that there is an open cofinite set $U$ meeting only finitely many elements of $\mathscr V$;
and any other element of $\mathscr V$ is contained in the (finite) complement of $U$, and so there are only finitely many of them.
And consequently, any $\sigma$-locally finite collection of subsets of $X$ must be countable.

Now let $\mathscr U$ be a $\sigma$-locally finite closed refinement of the open cover $\left\{ X \setminus \{p\} \mid p \in X \right\}$.
Every element of $\mathscr U$ is a closed proper subset of $X$, hence finite.
And $\mathscr U$ is countable.  Therefore, $X=\bigcup\mathscr U$ is countable.
