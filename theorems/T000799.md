Let $\mathscr V$ be any locally finite collection of $X$, then $\mathscr V$ is actually finite:

- Suppose $U$ is an open cofinite set that meets only finitely many elements of $\mathscr V$. Any other element of $\mathscr V$ is contained in the (finite) complement of $U$, and so there are only finitely many of them.

And therefore, any $\sigma$-locally finite collection of subsets of $X$ must be countable.

Let $\mathscr U$ be a $\sigma$-locally finite closed refinement for open cover $\left\{ X \setminus \{p\} \mid p \in X \right\}$, then $\left| X \right| = \left| \bigcup \mathscr U \right| \leq \sum_{F \in \mathscr U} \left| F \right| \leq \aleph_0$.
