If $X$ is zero dimensional, then given any open $U \subset X$ and $x \in U$ there is a clopen $V$ with $x \in V \subset U$.  The function equal to $0$ on $V$ and $1$ outside of $V$ is continuous and separates $x$ from the complement of $U$.

Asserted on page 33 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} for the regularity property.  Completely regularity is the simple modification above.
