Let $A\subseteq X$ and $p\in\overline A$.
Since $X$ is {P120}, $p$ has an open neighborhood $U$
that is orderable ({P133}), and hence also {P172}
[(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=LOTS%2B%7ERadial).
Because $p\in\overline{A\cap U}$, and thus $p\in\text{cl}_U(A\cap U)$,
it follows that there is a transfinite sequence of points of $A\cap U$ converging to $p$.
