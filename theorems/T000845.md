See Theorem 1.10 in {{zb:0285.54022}}.
There, the author assumes {P3} instead of {P99} (see section 1.7), but the latter is sufficient for the proof. {P3} is only used to show that if $x_1,x_2,\dots$ is a sequence converging to $x$, then $\{x,x_1,x_2,\dots\}$ is closed in $X$. But indeed, one can use the following general fact:

"If $x_1,x_2,\dots$ is a sequence in a {P99} space $X$ converging to a point $x\in X$, then the set $\{x,x_1,x_2,\dots\}$ is sequentially closed."

In combination with {T840}, the assertion follows.
