    name: Cozero complemented spaces; when the space of minimal prime ideals of a $C(X)$ is compact (Henriksen & Woods)
---

Given a cozero set $U$ in $X$, the open set $X\setminus\overline U$
contains a maximal collection $\mathscr V$ of pairwise disjoint nonempty cozero sets of $X$.
By {P29} $\mathscr V$ is countable,
hence $V=\bigcup\mathscr V$ is a cozero set.
And since $X$ is {P12}, the maximality of $\mathscr V$
implies that $V$ is dense in $X\setminus\overline U$.
So $V$ is a cozero complement of $U$.

See Example 1.6(d) in {{zb:1067.54015}}.
