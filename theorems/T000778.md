Any subspace of a {P203} space is {P203} or {P52}. Since [almost discrete spaces are paracompact](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=almost+discrete+%2B+not+paracompact) and [discrete spaces are paracompact](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=discrete+%2B+not+paracompact), it follows that any subspace of a {P203} space is {P30}.
