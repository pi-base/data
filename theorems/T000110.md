Suppose $X$ is a normal space which is not weakly countably compact.  There is a countably infinite closed discrete subset $A=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$ of $X$.  By the Tietze Extension Theorem, the continuous function $f$ on $A$ defined by $f(x_n)=n$ can be extended to an (unbounded) real-valued continuous function on all of $X$.  So $X$ is not pseudocompact.

Essentially shown on page 20 of {{zb:0386.54001}}.
