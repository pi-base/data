If $X$ is a connected subset of $\mathbb R$, it is necessarily order-convex (that is, $y\le x\le z$ with $y,z\in X$ implies $x\in X$). Given a point $a\in X$, define the map $F:X\times[0,1]\to X$ by $F(x,t)=(1-t)x+ta$.  This is well-defined and is a homotopy between the identity map on $X$ and a constant map.
