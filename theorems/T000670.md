Let $\mathscr U$ be a countable open cover of $X$.
Let $\mathscr V$ be a locally finite open refinement of $\mathscr U$ covering $X$.
Given a point $x\in X$, there is an open neighborhood $W$ of $x$ that intersects only finitely many members of $\mathscr V$.
But since $X$ is {P39}, $W$ intersects all (nonempty) members of $\mathscr V$;
hence $\mathscr V$ is finite.
That is sufficient to conclude that $\mathscr U$ has a finite subcover.
