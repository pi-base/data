By taking the Kolmogorov quotient we might assume that $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff.
The compact case follows from the cardinal inequality $t(X)\leq s(X)$ for compact Hausdorff $X$. See theorem 7.15 of {{zb:0559.54003}}.
The general case follows from $t(X) \leq t(\alpha X) \leq s(\alpha X) = s(X)$ where $\alpha X$ is the one-point compactification of $X$.
