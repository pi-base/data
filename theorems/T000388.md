We will use Ishikawa's characterization of {P33}.

Suppose $X$ is {P132}.
Let $F_0 \supseteq F_1 \supseteq \cdots$ be a nested sequence of closed sets with empty intersection.
Since each $F_n$ is a $G_\delta$ set, $F_n = \bigcap_{m \in \omega} U_{n, m}$ for some open sets $U_{n, m}$.

Define $U_k := \bigcap_{n \leq k, m \leq k} U_{n, m}$.
Clearly each $U_k$ is an open set and $F_k = \bigcap_{n \leq k} F_n = \bigcap_{n \leq k, m \in \omega} U_{n, m} \subseteq U_k$.
Finally, $\bigcap_{k \in \omega} U_k = \bigcap_{n \in \omega, m \in \omega} U_{n, m} = \bigcap_{m \in \omega} F_n = \varnothing$.

Therefore, $X$ is {P33}.
