It follows from {{zb:0066.41001}} that the necessary and suffcient condition that $X$ being {P33} is that, for any nested sequence of closed sets $F_0 \supseteq F_1 \supseteq \cdots$ such that $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} F_n = \varnothing$, there exists open sets $U_0 \supseteq U_1 \supseteq \cdots$ such that $U_i \supseteq F_i$ for each $i$ and $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} U_n = \varnothing$.

Now let $X$ be {P132} and $F_0 \supseteq F_1 \supseteq \cdots$ be an arbitrary nested sequence of closed sets. By perfectness, $F_n = \bigcap_{m \in \omega} U_{n, m}$ for open sets $U_{n, m}$.

Define $U_k := \bigcap_{n \leq k, m \leq k} U_{n, m}$ be open set. Clearly $\left\{ U_n \right\}_{n \in \omega}$ is decreasing and $F_k = \bigcap_{n \leq k} F_n = \bigcap_{n \leq k, m \in \omega} U_{n, m} \subseteq U_k$.
Finally $\bigcap_{k \in \omega} U_k = \bigcap_{n \in \omega, m \in \omega} U_{n, m} = \bigcap_{m \in \omega} F_n = \varnothing$.

Therefore, $X$ is {P33}.
