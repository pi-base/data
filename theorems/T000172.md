Every point has a neighborhood $U$ homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$.  That neighborhood $U$ is Baire as open in $\mathbb R^n$, which is Baire.  Since every point has a neighborhood that is a Baire space, $X$ is Baire.

See {{wikipedia:Baire_space}} and Corollary 1.22 in {{mr:MR0431104}} (<https://eudml.org/doc/268479>).
