Write $X = A\cup B$ where $A, B$ are disjoint and $|A| = |B| = |X|$. Take any map $f:X\to A$ such that $f(a) = a$ for $a\in A$ and $f\restriction_B$ is a bijection. If $F\subseteq A$ is finite, then $|f^{-1}(F)| = 2|F|$ so that $f^{-1}(F)$ is finite. This shows that $f$ is continuous, so that $A$ is a retract of $X$. But $A$ is a proper infinite subset of $X$, and so is not closed.
