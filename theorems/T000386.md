Take the space $H\subseteq \mathbb R^\kappa$ (by {P162}); its projection $H_\alpha\subseteq\mathbb R$
for each factor $\alpha<\kappa$ must be bounded (by {P22}), and thus $\overline{H_\alpha}$ is {P000016}
by the [Heine-Borel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem). This makes $H$
a closed subset of the {P000016} space $\prod_{\alpha<\kappa}\overline{H_\alpha}$, and thus {P000016}.
