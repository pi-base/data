By taking Kolmogorov quotient we can assume $X$ is $T_0$. If $X\subseteq \prod_\alpha X_\alpha$ is closed where $X_\alpha$ are metric spaces, and $\pi_\alpha:X\to X_\alpha$ are projections, then $\pi_\alpha(X)\subseteq X_\alpha$ is {P22} and {P53}, and so {P16}. It follows that $X$ is a closed subspace of the {P16} space $\prod_\alpha \pi_\alpha(X)$, and so {P16}.
