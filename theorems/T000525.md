See also [this post on Dan Ma's Topology Blog](https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/sigma-products-of-separable-metric-spaces-are-monolithic/),
noting that "strongly monolithic" means that the space's
density (minimum cardinality of a dense set) equals its
weight (minimum cardinality of a basis), so {P26} implies {P27}
(and in turn {P53} as we also have {P5}).
