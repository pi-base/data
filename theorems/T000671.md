By {{mathse:5016854}}, an almost discrete space that is not semiregular must be
the disjoint union of the {S10} and a {P52} space.

The {S10|P49}, {P52} implies extremally disconnected [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Discrete+%2B+%7EExtremally+disconnected),
and the disjoint union of two extremally disconnected spaces is itself extremally disconnected.
