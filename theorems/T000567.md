By {P94} choose a finite open neighborhood of each point. So $X$ can be covered by a family of finite sets, forming a chain under inclusion by {P196}. These sets must then all have distinct finite cardinalities, so the cardinality of their union can be at most $\aleph_0$, the cardinality of the natural numbers.
