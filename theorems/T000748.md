Let $x\in X$ and let $S_1, S_2, \dots\subseteq X$ be countably infinite sets, each converging to $x$.
Since $X$ is {P28}, the point $x$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods
$V_1\supseteq V_2\supseteq\dots$.
As $S_n$ converges to $x$, the set $T_n=S_n\cap V_n$ is cofinite in $S_n$ and also converges to $x$.

*Claim:* The set $S=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty T_n$ is as required in the definition of {P210}:
- (1) $S\cap S_n\supseteq T_n$ is cofinite in $S_n$ for each $n$.
- (2) To show that $S$ converges to $x$, consider a basic neighborhood $V_m$ of $x$ for some fixed $m$.
If $n\ge m$, we have $T_n\subseteq V_n\subseteq V_m$.
And for the finitely many $n<m$, $V_m$ contains all but finitely many elements of $T_n$ since $T_n$ converges to $x$.
Therefore, $V_m$ contains all but finitely many elements of $S$.
This shows that $S$ converges to $x$.
