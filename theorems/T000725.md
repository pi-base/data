Let $A\subseteq X$ be sequentially closed. If $x_i\in A$ is a well-ordered net with uncountable cofinality such that $x_i\to x$, let $\{x\} = \bigcap_n U_n$ where $U_n$ are open. There exist $i_n$ such that $x_i\in U_n$ for $i\geq i_n$. Then $x_i = x$ for $i\geq \sup_n i_n$, so that $x\in A$. It follows that $A$ is radially closed, and so closed since $X$ is pseudoradial.
