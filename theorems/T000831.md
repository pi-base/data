Let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $X$.
Let $U$ be a minimal open set in $X$ with $U\cap A\ne\emptyset$.
The set $U\cap A$ cannot contain two distinct points;
otherwise, by the {P1} property there would be an open set $V$ in $X$ containing one point and not the other.
Then $U\cap V$ would be a strictly smaller open set that meets $A$, which is not possible.
Thus, the element of $U\cap A$ is isolated in $A$.
