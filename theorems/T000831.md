For $x \in X$, let $U_x\subseteq X$ be its minimal open neighborhood, this is well-defined by {T824}.
Let $U_z$ be a minimal member of the collection $\{U_x\mid x \in X\}$.

Suppose $U_z$ contains $y \neq z$. Then by {P1} it follows $U_y \subsetneq U_z$, contradiction.

Therefore $X$ has an isolated point. Since both {P1} and {P226} are hereditary, the assertion follows.
