## Theorem Suggestion

If a space is:

- [P1](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000001)
- [P2](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000002)
- not [P3](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000003)

then it is [P4](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000004).

## Rationale

This theorem would demonstrate that no spaces satisfy the following search:

https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=%24T_0%2B%24T_1%24%2B~%24T_2%24%2B~%24T_%7B2%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%24

## Proof/References

The result is trivial and essentially shown on page XYZ of Willard's topology, but was also discussed at [this Math.StackExchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4778063).
