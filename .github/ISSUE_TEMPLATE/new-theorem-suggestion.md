## Theorem Suggestion

If a space is:

- **scattered** [P51](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000051)
- not **empty** [P137](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000137)

then it is **strongly Choquet** [P206](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000206).

## Rationale

This theorem would demonstrate that no spaces satisfy the following search:

https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Scattered%2B%7EEmpty%2B%7EStrongly+Choquet

## Proof/References

The result is essentially shown on page xxx of Willard's topology,
but was also discussed at [this Math.StackExchange post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4778063).
