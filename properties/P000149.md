Every $\omega$-cover of $X$ has a countable $\omega$-subcover.  (A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of $X$ is called an *$\omega$-cover* if each finite subset of $X$ is contained in an element of $\mathcal U$ and $X \notin \mathcal U$.)

Equivalently, every finite power of $X$ is {P18}.

See {{zb:0503.54020}}; the equivalence with every finite power being {P18} is on page 156.

The name $\omega$-Lindelöf used in e.g.
{{zb:1153.54009}} is motivated as the adaptation of
{P18} for $\omega$-covers. This property is
often called $\varepsilon$-space as it originally appeared
as the fifth item "$\varepsilon$" in a list from
{{zb:0503.54020}}.
