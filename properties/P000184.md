Can be expressed as a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$ for some finite $n$.

Per theorem Theorem 1.11.4 of {{mr:0482697}}, this is equivalent to being {P27}, {P53}, and finite-dimensional, using any of the small inductive, large inductive, or covering dimensions by Theorem 1.7.7. See the source for further details.
