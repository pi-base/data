Any subspace $Y \subseteq X$ with $|Y|=|X|$ is homeomorphic to $X$.

In {{zb:0755.54002}}, William Weiss notes (as quoted by AndrÃ©s E. Caicedo
in {{mo:24144}}):

> [This] is of course related to the Toronto seminar problem of whether there is
> an uncountable non-discrete space which is homeomorphic to each of its uncountable subspaces.
> There are rules for working on this latter problem. The problem can be worked upon only in
> groups of three or more mathematicians, and it is required that alcohol, preferably beer,
> be present during this time. Contact anyone in the Toronto Set Theory Seminar for the current
> status of the problem. It may never be solved."
