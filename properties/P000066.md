---
A space that satisfies the selection principle
\(S_{fin}(\mathcal{O},\mathcal{O})\): for every sequence of open covers
\(\mathcal{U}_n\) for \(n<\omega\), there exist finite subcollections
$\mathcal{F}_n\subseteq\mathcal{U}_n$ such that \(\bigcup_{n<\omega}\mathcal{F}_n\) is
also an open cover.

See section 5 of {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4}}.
