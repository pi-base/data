$X=\bigcup_{n<\omega}R_n$, where $R_n$ is relatively compact to $X$.  Here, a set $A\subseteq X$ is called *relatively compact to* $X$ if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcollection which covers $A$.

See Definition 4.2 in {{doi:10.14712/1213-7243.2015.201}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
