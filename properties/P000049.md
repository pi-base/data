The closure of every open set in $X$ is open or, equivalently, clopen.

Equivalently, any two disjoint open sets have disjoint closures.

Defined in problem 15G of {{zb:1052.54001}} and problem 1H of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}.

{{doi:1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} defines it on page 32 with the additional assumption of {P3}, which we do not assume here.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets (see Problem 15G.2 in {{zb:1052.54001}}).
- This property is hereditary with respect to dense sets (see {{mathse:3769214}}).
- This property is hereditary with respect to locally dense sets (equivalent to previous two meta-properties; see also Proposition 1 of {{mathse:5025114}}).
A set $A\subseteq X$ is called *locally dense* (or *preopen*) if every $x\in A$ has neighbourhood $U$ with $U\cap A$ dense in $U$ (equivalently, $A\subseteq\operatorname{int}(\overline A)$).
