A space in which the closure of every open set is open.

Equivalently, a space in which any two disjoint open sets have disjoint closures.

Defined in problem 15G of {{mr:MR2048350}} and problem 1H of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}.

{{doi:1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} defines it on page 32 with the additional assumption of {P3}, which we do not assume here.
