A {P16} {P73} space for which the collection of compact open subsets is
closed under finite intersections and forms a base for the topology.

In the theory of Stone duality, for every bounded distributive lattice there exists a unique spectral space whose compact open subsets are order-isomorphic to that lattice and whose points are the prime ideals of the lattice. Additionally, spectra of commutative rings endowed with the Zariski topology are spectral spaces and vice versa, although this association is not one-to-one. For a comprehensive overview of this and other information on spectral spaces, see {{doi:10.1017/9781316543870}}.

See example 21, section 2.6 of {{mr:1077251}} and the section on [Spectral spaces](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08YF) from the Stacks project.
