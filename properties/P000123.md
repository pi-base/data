There exists some integer $n\ge 0$ such that each point of the
space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$
with its Euclidean topology. Equivalently, each point has a neighborhood
homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$. Note that the value of $n$ is not allowed
to differ between points; if it can vary, then the space has the weaker
property {P122}.

In the case that $n=0$, the point having a neighborhood homeomorphic to
$\mathbb R^0=\{0\}$ means it is an isolated point.

Defined on page 316 of {{zb:0951.54001}} and on page 38 of {{mr:2766102}}.
