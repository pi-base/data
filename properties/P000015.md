    name: Why are these two definitions of a perfectly normal space equivalent?
---

For any disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$ in $X$,
there is a continuous function $f: X \rightarrow [0,1]$
such that $f^{-1}(\{0\}) = A$ and $f^{-1}(\{1\}) = B$.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

- $X$ is {P13} and a {P132} (i.e., every closed set is a $G_\delta$ set).

- Every closed set in $X$ is a zero set (i.e., $f^{-1}(0)$ for some continuous $f:X\to[0,1]$).

- Every open set in $X$ is a cozero set (i.e., $f^{-1}((0,1])$ for some continuous $f:X\to[0,1]$).

The equivalence between the these conditions (Vedenissoff's theorem) is shown for example
in Theorem 1.5.19 of {{zb:0684.54001}} (under the assumption of a {P2} space,
but the proof does not use that assumption).  See also {{mathse:72138}}.

Defined on page 16 of {{zb:0386.54001}} (as perfectly \(T_4\)).

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary (see Theorem 2.1.6 in {{zb:0684.54001}}).
