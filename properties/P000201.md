There exists a generic point $p \in X$.

The point $p$ is called a *generic point* of $X$ if any of the following equivalent conditions holds:

- $\{p\}$ is dense in $X$.
- $X$ is the only closed set containing $p$.
- $p$ is an element of every nonempty open subset of $X$.
- $p$ is a *generalization* of every point of $X$, according to the specialization preorder. See {{wikipedia:Specialization_(pre)order}}.
- The topology is coarser than or equal to an included point/particular point topology (e.g. {S8}).

Compare with {P202}.
