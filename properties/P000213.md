$X$ is an $\alpha_4$ space if for all $x \in X$ and for all countable collections of sequences $\gamma$ converging to $x$ there exists a sequence $B$ converging to $x$ such that $A\cap B$ is nonempty for infinitely many $A \in \gamma$.

The $\alpha_i$ properties for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$ are due to Arkhangel’skii however the definition stated here is as presented by Nyikos in {{zb:0774.54019}}.
