Given a space $X$ and a point $x \in X$, a point $x \in X$, $x$ is said to be an $\alpha_4$ point if  whenever $\gamma$ is a countable collection of sequences converging to $x$ there exists a sequence $B$ converging to $x$ such that $A\cap B$ is nonempty for infinitely many $A \in \gamma$.

$X$ is an $\alpha_4$ space if each of it's points are $\alpha_4$ points.

The $\alpha_i$ properties for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$ are due to Arkhangel’skii and were developped to study and better understand the productivity of Frechet-Urysohn spaces ({{zb:0275.54004}}). The definition stated here is as presented by Nyikos in {{mr:0394575}}.
