Every point $x \in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that the homomorphism $i_*:\pi_1(U, x) \to\pi_1(X,x)$ of fundamental groups induced by the inclusion $i: U \hookrightarrow X$ is trivial.

Equivalently, for every loop based at $x$ whose image lies in $U$, there exists a basepoint-preserving homotopy in $X$ to the constant loop at $x$.

Defined on page 494 of {{zb:0951.54001}} and on page 63 of {{zb:1044.55001}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to clopen sets.
- $X$ satisfies this property iff each of its path components does.
- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
- This property is preserved by finite products.
