For every $x \in X$ and every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that
$V \subset U$ and the inclusion map $V \hookrightarrow U$ is homotopic to a constant map $V \to U$.

The name "locally contractible" may also refer to {P230}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets.
- $X$ satisfies this property if its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
