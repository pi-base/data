Every point $x \in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that the homomorphism $i_*:\pi_1(U, x) \to\pi_1(X,x)$ of fundamental groups induced by the inclusion $i: U \hookrightarrow X$ is trivial.

Equivalently, every loop based at $x$ whose image lies in $U$ is homotopic in $X$ to the constant path at $x$, relative to the basepoint.

Defined on page 494 of {{zb:0951.54001}} and on page 63 of {{zb:1044.55001}}.
