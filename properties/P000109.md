There are several equivalent definitions.
See {{wikipedia:Monotonically_normal_space}} for a few more.

**Definition (1)**: (see Definition 2.1 in {{zb:0269.54009}})

The space is {P2} and there is a function $G$ that assigns to each
ordered pair $(A,B)$ of disjoint closed sets in $X$ an open set $G(A,B)$ such that:
- (i) $A\subseteq G(A,B)\subseteq \overline{G(A,B)}\subseteq X\setminus B$;
- (ii) $G(A,B)\subseteq G(A',B')$ whenever $A\subseteq A'$ and $B'\subseteq B$.

The operator $G$ is called a *monotone normality operator*.

One can always choose $G$ to satisfy the property

$\quad G(A,B)\cap G(B,A)=\emptyset,$

by replacing each $G(A,B)$ by $G(A,B)\setminus\overline{G(B,A)}$.

**Definition (2)**: (see Theorem 2.2(e) in {{zb:1327.54003}} and references there)

The space is {P2} and there is a function $\mu$ that assigns to each pair $(x,U)$ with $U$ open in $X$ and $x\in U$ an open set $\mu(x,U)$ such that:
- (i) $x\in\mu(x,U)$;
- (ii) if $\mu(x,U)\cap\mu(y,V)\ne\emptyset$, then $x\in V$ or $y\in U$.

Such a function $\mu$ automatically satisfies

$\quad x\in\mu(x,U)\subseteq\overline{\mu(x,U)}\subseteq U$.

*Note 1*: It is sufficient to assume the function $\mu$ is defined for $U$ belonging to a base for the topology.

*Note 2*: It is not necessarily the case that $\mu(x,U)$ satisfies monotonicity in $U$,
that is, $\mu(x,U)\subseteq\mu(x,U')$ if $x\in U\subseteq U'$.
But one can construct a modified function

$\quad \nu(x,U)=\bigcup\{\mu(x,W):W\text{ open, }x\in W\subseteq U\}$,

which does satisfy (i), (ii), and monotonicity in $U$.

**Equivalence between the two definitions**: (see {{zb:0257.54018}})

Given $G$ from Definition (1) with the condition $G(A,B)\cap G(B,A)=\emptyset$,
the function $\mu(x,U)=G(\{x\},X\setminus U)$ satisfies Definition (2).

Given $\mu$ from Definition (2) and the associated function $\nu$,
the function $G(A,B)=\bigcup\{\nu(x,X\setminus B):x\in A\}$ satisfies Definition (1).

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary (easy consequence of Definition (2)).
