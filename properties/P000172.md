A space such that for each $A\subseteq X$ and each $p\in \overline A$ there is a transfinite sequence $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha<\lambda}$ of points of $A$ converging to $p$.  (Here $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal and can always be taken to be a regular cardinal.)

See the chapter "d-4 Pseudoradial spaces" in {{zb:1059.54001}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
