Any of the following equivalent properties holds:

- Given any two distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other point.
- Points are closed in $X$ (that is, for each $x\in X$ the singleton $\{x\}$ is closed).
- Each point is an intersection of open sets.
- Every subset of $X$ is the intersection of all the open sets containing it.
