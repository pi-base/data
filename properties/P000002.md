Given any two distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other point.

Equivalently, any of the following equivalent properties holds:

- Points are closed in $X$ (that is, for each $x\in X$ the singleton $\{x\}$ is closed).
- {P78} subspaces are {P52}.
- Each point is an intersection of open sets.
- Each point is an intersection of its neighborhoods.

See {{wikipedia:T1_space}} for a more extensive list.
