For every countable closed set $H$ and open set $U\supseteq H$,
there exists an open set $V$ with $H\subseteq V\subseteq cl(V)\subseteq U$.
In other words, countable closed sets have arbitrarily small closed neighborhoods.

Equivalently, any two disjoint closed sets, at least one of which is countable, can be separated by open sets.

Defined for example on p. 8 of {{zb:1411.54002}}.
