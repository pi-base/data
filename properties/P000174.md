Each point $x\in X$ has a neighborhood base well-ordered by reverse inclusion.

Equivalently, each point $x\in X$ has a neighborhood base totally ordered by reverse inclusion.  The two are equivalent since a linear order admits a well-ordered cofinal subset.

Such spaces are called *well-based* in {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2014.08.002}} and *lob-spaces* (lob = "linearly ordered (local) base") in {{mr:0540476}}.

One says that $X$ is *well-based at the point $x$* if the conditions above hold at the specific point.
So $X$ is well-based if it is well-based at every point.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is hereditary.
