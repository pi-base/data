For every discrete family $(F_i)_{i \in I}$  of closed subsets of $X$, there exists a pairwise disjoint family of open sets $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ with $F_i \subseteq U_i$ for all $i$.

Equivalently, for every discrete family $(F_i)_{i \in I}$  of closed subsets of $X$, there exists a discrete family of open sets $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ with $F_i \subseteq U_i$ for all $i$.

Terminology:
- A *discrete family* is a family of subsets such that each point of $X$ has a neighborhood meeting at most one of the subsets.
- In the first definition, the family of open sets $(U_i)_i$ is sometimes called a *disjoint open expansion* of the family $(F_i)_i$.
- In the second definition, the family of open sets $(U_i)_i$ is sometimes called a *discrete open expansion* of the family $(F_i)_i$. (See for example {{doi:10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00163-0}}.)

The equivalence between the two definitions is Theorem 5.1.17 of {{zb:0684.54001}}.

Defined on page 168 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}};
also on page 305 of {{zb:0684.54001}} with the additional assumption of {P2}, which we do not assume here.

Occasionally abbreviated as "CWN", as in {{zb:0529.54017}}.
