A $T_{2 \frac{1}{2}}$ space is one in which distinct points are separated by closed neighborhoods.
In other words, a space is $T_{2 \frac{1}{2}}$ if, given any two distinct points $a$ and $b$, there are open sets $O_a$ and $O_b$ containing $a$ and $b$, respectively, such that $cl(O_a)$ and $cl(O_b)$ are disjoint.
