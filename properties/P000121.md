A space $X$ whose topology is induced by some pseudometric.

A *pseudometric* on $X$ is a map $d:X\times X\to\Bbb{R}$ such that for all $x,y,z \in X$
(i) $d(x,y) \geq 0$ and $d(x,x)=0$,
(ii) $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$,
(iii) $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.
That is, a pseudometric satisfies the same properties as a metric, except that distinct points can have $d(x,y)=0$.
The topology induced by $d$ is the topology generated by all the open balls $B(x,\epsilon) = \{y \in X:d(x,y)<\epsilon\}$ with $x\in X$, $\epsilon>0$.

Defined in Example 3.2(a) of {{zb:1052.54001}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ is {P121} iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ is {P53}.
- This property is hereditary.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
