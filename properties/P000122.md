Each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$
with its Euclidean topology for some $n\ge 0$. Equivalently, each point has a neighborhood
homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$ for some $n$. Note that the value of $n$ is allowed
to differ between points; if it does not vary the space is {P123}.

In the case that $n=0$, the point having a neighborhood homeomorphic to
$\mathbb R^0=\{0\}$ means it is an isolated point.

The closely related {P123} property is
defined on page 316 of {{zb:0951.54001}} and on page 38 of {{mr:2766102}}.
