For a set $X$, a function $d:X^2\to[0,\infty)$ is called a *symmetric*
if it satisfies reflexivity ($d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y$) and symmetry
($d(x,y)=d(y,x)$). A space $X$ is called *semimetrizable* if
there is a symmetric $d:X^2\to[0,\infty)$ such that the neighborhood balls
$B(x,\varepsilon)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}$ for $\varepsilon>0$
form a neighborhood basis at each point $x\in X$. Such a symmetric is called a *semimetric*.
(Note that {{zb:0116.14303}} demonstrates that
these neighborhood balls need not be open sets.)

Equivalently:
- There exists a symmetric $d$ such that $p$ lies in the closure of some $Y\subseteq X$ iff $d(p,Y)=\inf\{d(p,y):y\in Y\}=0$.
Such a symmetric is automatically a semimetric.
- $X$ is {P2}. And, for each $x \in X$, there is a non-increasing sequence of open sets $\{G_n(x):n<\omega\}$ forming a local neighborhood basis for $x$. Moreover, if for some sequence $x_n$ in $X$, $y\in X$ belongs to $G_n(x_n)$ for all $n$, then $x_n\to y$. In particular, $X$ is {P28}. This equivalence is shown in Theorem 3.2 of {{zb:0113.16501}}.

Defined in e.g. {{zb:0113.16501}} and {{doi:10.2991/978-94-6239-216-8}}. Note that some sources, e.g., {{doi:10.2307/2370790}}, use the term semimetric to refer to a symmetric and the term semimetrizable to refer to {P205}.
