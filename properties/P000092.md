A space which is the union of an increasing sequence of {P16} {P3} subsets
$K_1\subseteq K_2 \subseteq K_3 \subseteq \cdots$ such that a set is closed (resp. open) whenever
its intersection with each $K_n$ is closed (resp. open) in $K_n$.

(N.B. The requirement that this sequence be
increasing cannot be eliminated.  For example,
{S65} satisfies the requirement without the increasing condition,
but is not {P92}.)

Defined as "$k_\omega$-space" in {{zb:0416.54027}}
(available [here](https://topology.nipissingu.ca/tp/reprints/v02/tp02105.pdf))
and on page 209 of {{doi:10.1016/0016-660X(75)90021-5}}.
The corresponding notion without requiring that each $K_n$ be {P3} is
{P98}. See also {P140}, {P141},
and {P142}.
