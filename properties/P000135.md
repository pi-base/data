Given any two topologically distinguishable points, each has a neighborhood not including the other point. (Two points are *topologically distinguishable* if there is an open set containing one of the points and not the other.)

Equivalently, any of the following equivalent properties holds:

- The Kolmogorov quotient of the space is {P2}.
- Every neighborhood of a point $x\in X$ contains $\operatorname{cl}\{x\}$.
- Every open set is a union of closed sets.
- For each $x\in X$, the closure $\operatorname{cl}\{x\}$ is precisely the set of points topologically indistinguishable from $x$.
- The closures of any two points are either identical or disjoint (so $\{\operatorname{cl}\{x\}\mid x\in X\}$ is a partition of the space $X$).

See {{wikipedia:T1_space}} for a more extensive list.

Also defined in definition 16.6, p. 438 of {{mr:1417259}} as "symmetric space". Not to be confused with symmetric spaces from Riemannian geometry.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ is {P135} iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ is {P2}.
