A space $X$ such that the diagonal $\Delta=\{(x,x):x\in X\}$ is a $G_\delta$ set in $X\times X$.

Equivalently, $X$ has a *$G_\delta$-diagonal sequence*, that is, a sequence of open covers
$\mathscr U_1,\mathscr U_2, \dots$ such that
$\{x\}=\bigcap_n\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)$ for all $x\in X$.
Here, $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)=\bigcup\{U\in\mathscr U_n:x\in U\}$.

For the equivalence, see Theorem 2.2 in {{zb:0555.54015}} or Lemma 1 in

See Definition 2.1 in {{zb:0555.54015}}.
