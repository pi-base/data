Every nonempty irreducible (= {P39}) closed subset of $X$ is the closure of exactly one point of $X$;
that is, every nonempty irreducible closed subset has a unique *generic point*.
(See {P201} for several equivalent formulations.)

Special case:
$X$ is sober and {P2} $\iff$ every nonempty irreducible subset is a singleton.

See {{wikipedia:Sober_space}} and also 
the section on [Irreducible components](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/004U) from the Stacks project.

Note: Without the uniqueness of the generic points, the corresponding property is {P192}.

#### Meta-properties

- The Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ is {P73} iff $X$ is {P192}.
