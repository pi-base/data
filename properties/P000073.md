Every nonempty irreducible (= {P39}) closed subset of $X$ is the closure of exactly one point of $X$;
that is, every nonempty irreducible closed subset has a unique *generic point*.

See {P201} for several equivalent formulations.

See {{wikipedia:Sober_space}} and also 
the section on [Irreducible components](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/004U) from the Stacks project.

Note: Without the uniqueness of the generic points, the corresponding property is {P192}.
