A {P36} space which cannot be partitioned into two {P36} subsets, each with at least two points.

Equivalently, a {P36} space which does not contain two disjoint {P36} subsets, each with at least two points.

See for example {{mathse:4654942}} for a proof of the equivalence.

Defined on page 33 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.  See also for example {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(95)00005-2}}.
