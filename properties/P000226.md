A space for which every collection of open sets has a minimal element.

Equivalently:
- Every collection of closed sets has a maximal element.
- The open sets satisfy the *descending chain condition*: There is no infinite strictly decreasing sequence $O_1 \supsetneq O_2 \supsetneq \cdots$ of open sets.
- The closed sets satisfy the *ascending chain condition*: There is no infinite strictly increasing sequence $Y_1 \subsetneq Y_2 \subsetneq \cdots$ of closed sets.

See Section 1 of {{zb:0392.54005}}.

Compare this property with {P208}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary.
- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
