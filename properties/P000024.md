Each point has a local base of neighborhoods with compact closure.

Equivalently (see Condition 2 of {{wikipedia:Locally_compact_space}}), every point in $X$ has
a closed and compact neighborhood.

Defined on page 20 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} as "strongly locally compact". Contrast with {P130}.
