P1 has a winning strategy at each point $x\in X$ 
for the following game defined by Gruenhage in
{{doi:10.1016/0016-660X(76)90024-6}}.

During each round $n<\omega$, P1 chooses some neighborhood $U_n$ of $x$,
then P2 chooses some point $p_n\in U_n$. P1 wins provided the sequence
$p_n$ converges to $x$; P2 wins otherwise.

Note that this property is hereditary: any space contained in a {P187} space
is also {P187}.
