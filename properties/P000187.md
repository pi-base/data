P1 has a winning strategy at each point $x\in X$ 
for the following game defined by Gruenhage in {{zb:0327.54019}}.

During each round $n<\omega$, P1 chooses some neighborhood $U_n$ of $x$,
then P2 chooses some point $x_n\in U_n$. P1 wins provided the sequence
of $x_n$ converges to $x$; P2 wins otherwise.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary.
- This property is preserved by countable products (see Theorem 4.1 of {{zb:0327.54019}}).
- This property is preserved by $\Sigma$-products (see Theorem 4.6 of {{zb:0327.54019}}).
- A locally $W$-space (every point has a neighborhood with the property) is a $W$-space.
