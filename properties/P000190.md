The space is homeomorphic to an ordinal number $\alpha$, viewed as the set of ordinals less than $\alpha$, together with the corresponding order topology.  For each point $\beta<\alpha$, the collection of intervals $(\gamma,\beta]$ with $\gamma<\beta$ forms a local base of open neighborhoods of $\beta$.

Equivalently, the topology is the order topology induced by a well-order on the underlying set.
