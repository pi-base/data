A space that is {P17} and {P23}.

Equivalently, $X=\bigcup_{n<\omega}K_n$ where for each $x\in X$, there exists
$n<\omega$ such that $K_n$ is a compact neighborhood of $x$.

Equivalently, $X=\bigcup_{n<\omega}K_n$ for $K_n$ compact, and such that $K_n\subseteq int(K_{n+1})$.

The equivalences above can be shown using the ideas in {{mathse:4568032}}.

Defined on page 21 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} as "$\sigma$-locally compact".
