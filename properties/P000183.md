A space with a (finite or infinite) countable $k$-network.

Equivalently:
- A space with countable pseudobase.
- A space with countable $cs$-network.
- A space with countable $cs^\ast$-network.

A family $\mathcal N$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *$k$-network* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K\subseteq U$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq \mathcal{N}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq U$.

A family $\mathcal{N}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *pseudobase* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K\subseteq U$, there exists some $A\in\mathcal{N}$ with $K \subseteq A \subseteq U$.

A family $\mathcal{N}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *$cs$-network* if for every open set $U\subseteq X$, point $x\in U$ and sequence $(x_n)$ converging to $x$, there exists some $A\in\mathcal{N}$ with $x_n\in A$ for all but finitely many $n$.

A family $\mathcal{N}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *$cs^\ast$-network* if for every open set $U\subseteq X$, point $x\in U$ and sequence $(x_n)$ converging to $x$, there exists some $A\in\mathcal{N}$ with $x_n\in A$ for infinitely many $n$.

To see the equivalence, first note that a pseudobase is a $k$-network, a $k$-network is a $cs$-network and a $cs$-network is a $cs^\ast$-network. In {{mo:506308}} it is shown that if $X$ has countable $cs^\ast$-network, then it has a countable $k$-network. Then finite unions of elements of that $k$-network form a countable pseudobase.
