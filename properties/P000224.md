Every point $x \in X$ has a neighborhood $U$, such that the homomorphism $i^*:\pi(U, x) \to\pi(X,x)$ of fundamental groups induced by the inclusion $i : U \hookrightarrow X$, is trivial.

In elementary terms this means that for every continuous path $p:[0,1]\to U$ with $p(0) = p(1)$, there is a continuous map (homotopy), $H:[0,1]^2\to X$ such that $H(0, \vdash) = H(1, \vdash) = H(\vdash, 1)=p(0)$ and $H(\vdash, 0) = i \circ p$.

Defined on page 63 of {{zb:1044.55001}}.
