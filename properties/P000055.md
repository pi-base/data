The topology on the space $X$ is induced by some complete metric $d$,
that is, a metric for which every Cauchy sequence converges.

A sequence $(x_n)_n$ is *Cauchy* provided for each distance $\epsilon>0$, there is
a natural number $N$ for which $d(x_i,x_j)<\epsilon$ for all $i,j>N$.

See Definition 24.2 in {{zb:1052.54001}}.
Defined on page 37 of {{zb:0386.54001}} as "topologically complete".

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to $G_\delta$ sets and,
in particular, with respect to open sets and closed sets
(see Theorem 24.12 in {{zb:1052.54001}}).
- This property is preserved by countable products (see Theorem 24.11 in {{zb:1052.54001}}).
