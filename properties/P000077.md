$X$ is homeomorphic to a compact subspace of a $\Sigma$-product of real lines.
By homogeneity of the real line, one can assume the $\Sigma$-product is of the form

$\quad Y=\{x=(x_\alpha)\in\mathbb R^\Gamma:\{\alpha:x_\alpha\ne 0\}\text{ is countable}\}$

for some set $\Gamma$.
The space $Y$ has the topology of pointwise convergence induced from
the product topology of $\mathbb R^\Gamma$.
