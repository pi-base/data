---
A space that satisfies the selection principle
\(S_{1}(\mathcal{O},\mathcal{O})\): for every sequence of open covers
\(\mathcal{U}_n\) for \(n<\omega\), there exist choices
\(V_n\in\mathcal{U}_n\) such that \(\{V_n:n<\omega\}\) is
also an open cover.

See section 6 of {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4}}.
