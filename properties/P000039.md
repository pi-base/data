The space has no disjoint nonempty open sets. Equivalently, every nonempty open set is dense.

Defined on page 29 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}. Defined as "anti-Hausdorff" in {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(93)90147-6}}.

See {{wikipedia:Hyperconnected_space}} for other equivalent characterizations.
