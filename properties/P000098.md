A space which is the union of an increasing sequence of {P16} subsets
$K_1\subseteq K_2 \subseteq K_3 \subseteq \cdots$ such that a set is closed (resp. open) whenever
its intersection with each $K_n$ is closed (resp. open) in $K_n$.

Equivalently, a space which is the union of countably-many
{P16} subsets $K_n$ (without requiring
$K_n\subseteq K_{n+1}$)
such that a set is closed (resp. open) whenever
its intersection with each $K_n$ is closed (resp. open) in $K_n$.

Defined as "$k_\omega$-space" on page 13 of {{zb:0288.22006}}.
The corresponding notion requiring that each $K_n$ be {P3} is {P92}.
See also {P140}, {P141}, and {P142}.
