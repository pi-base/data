A {P12} space such that there exists a uniformity
generating the topology of the space such that the
entourage-picker has a winning strategy in Bell's proximal game introduced
in {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2014.06.014}}.

Equivalently, the entourage-picker has a winning strategy for
this variation defined as Game 1.11 of
{{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2016.03.022}}: during round $0$,
the entourage-picker chooses an entourage $D_0$ of the diagonal from
the {P12} space's universal uniformity, and the point-picker
chooses some point $x_0$. Then during round $n+1$, the entourage-picker chooses an
entourage $D_{n+1}$, and the point-picker chooses some point $x_{n+1}\in D_n[x_n]$.
The entourage-picker wins provided that either the sequence $x_n$ converges
or the intersection $\bigcap_{n<\omega}D_n[x_n]$ is empty.

Note that while many authors require {P76} spaces to be {P3}
(equivalently, {P1}),
we do not require this separation axiom here.
