A space in which any two topologically distinguishable points can be separated by disjoint neighbourhoods. (Two points are *topologically distinguishable* if there is an open set containing one of the points and not the other.)

Equivalently, a space whose Kolmogorov quotient is Hausdorff.

Defined in {{wikipedia:Hausdorff_space}}, and in definition 16.10, p. 439 of {{mr:1417259}}.
