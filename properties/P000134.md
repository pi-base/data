A space in which any two topologically distinguishable points can be separated by disjoint neighbourhoods. (Two points are topologically distinguishable if there is an open set containing one of the points and not the other.)  Equivalently, a space whose Kolmogorov quotient is Hausdorff.

Defined in {{wikipedia:Hausdorff_space}}, and in definition 16.10, p. 439 of {{mr:1417259}}.
