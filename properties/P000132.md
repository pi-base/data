A space in which every closed set is a $G_\delta$ set (a countable intersection of open sets).
Equivalently, a space in which every open set is an $F_\sigma$ set (a countable union of closed sets).

Defined on page 162 of {{zb:0386.54001}}.

Note: A $G_\delta$ space is sometimes called a "perfect space" (Exercise 1.5.H(a) in {{zb:0684.54001}}). Not to be be confused with a space that is a "perfect" in the sense of "perfect set" (= a set equal to its derived set = a closed set that is dense-in-itself), that is, a space without isolated point. See the discussion in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Perfect_set#Terminology_issue>.
