A space in which every closed set is a $G_\delta$.  Equivalently, a space in which every open set is an $F_\sigma$.

Defined on page 162 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.

Note: A $G_\delta$ space is sometimes called a "perfect space" (Exercise 1.5.H(a) in {{zb:0684.54001}}). But that could be confused with a space that is a "perfect" in the sense of "perfect set" (= a set equal to its derived set), that is, a space without isolated point. See the discussion in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Perfect_set#Terminology_issue>.
