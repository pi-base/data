The closure of every cozero set in $X$ is open (hence clopen).

A *cozero set* is a set of the form $\{x\in X:f(x)>0\}$ for some continuous function $f:X\to\mathbb R$;
equivalently, the complement of a zero set.

Equivalently, any two disjoint open sets, at least one of which is a cozero set, have disjoint closures.

Defined in problem 1H of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}.

No additional separation axiom is assumed here.
