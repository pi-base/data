Each point has a local basis of compact neighborhoods.

Given as condition (3) in {{wikipedia:Locally_compact_space}}.  See also the article "What is locally compact?" on p. 390 [here](http://www.pme-math.org/journal/issues/PMEJ.Vol.9.No.6.pdf), which discusses various kinds of local compactness.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets.
- This property is hereditary with respect to closed sets.
- This property is hereditary with respect to locally closed sets (equivalent to previous two meta-properties).
A set $A \subseteq X$ is called [*locally closed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_closed_subset) if every $x \in A$ has neighbourhood $U$ with $U \cap A$ closed in $U$ (equivalently, $A$ is the intersection of an open set and a closed set).
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
