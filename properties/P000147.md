---

A space in which every countable intersection of open sets is open.

Equivalently, a space in which every countable union of closed sets is closed.

Equivalently, a space in which every point is a P-point, that is, a point for which the family of neighborhoods is closed under countable intersections.

Defined in {{doi:10.1016/0016-660X(72)90026-8}} with the additional assumption of {P2}, which is not assumed here.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
