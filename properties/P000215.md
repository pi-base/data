Every subspace is {P162}. 

The following are equivalent for a {P6} space $X$ (see theorem 8.17 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}):

1. $X$ is hereditarily realcompact.

2. If $x\in X$, then $X\setminus \{x\}$ is realcompact.

3. If $f:Y\to X$ is continuous and injective where $Y$ is $T_{3.5}$, then $Y$ is realcompact.

4. If $f:Y\to X$ is continuous, $Y$ is $T_{3.5}$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ is compact for all $x\in X$, then $Y$ is realcompact.
