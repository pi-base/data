Each point has a neighbourhood that is orderable ({P133}).

This is equivalent to each of the following:
- Each point has an open neighbourhood that is orderable.
- Each point has a local base of orderable neighbourhoods.
- The topology of $X$ has a base consisting of orderable open sets.

The equivalences can be shown similarly to the proof of Proposition 2.4 in {{zb:1458.54023}}.

First introduced in the PhD dissertation of H. Herrlich {{mr:154246}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
