Each point has a neighbourhood that is orderable ({P133}).

This is equivalent to each of the following:
- Each point has an open neighbourhood that is orderable.
- Every point has a local base of orderable neighbourhoods.
- The topology of $X$ has a base consisting of orderable open sets.

First introduced in the PhD dissertation of H. Herrlich {{mr:154246}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets (Proposition 2.4 in {{doi:10.4467/20842589RM.20.006.12438}}).
- An arbitrary disjoint union of locally ordered spaces is locally ordered.
