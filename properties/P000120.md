Each point has a neighbourhood that is {P133}.

This is equivalnet to each of the following:
- Every point has a neighbourhood base consisting of orderable sets.
- There exists an open cover consisting of orderable sets.
- There exists a base for the topology consisting of orderable sets.

First introduced in the PhD dissertation of H. Herrlich {{mr:154246}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets (Proposition 2.4 in {{doi:10.4467/20842589RM.20.006.12438}}).
- An arbitrary disjoint union of locally ordered spaces is locally ordered.
