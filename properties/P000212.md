For every point $x \in X$ and every countable collection $\gamma$
of (injective) sequences converging to $x$ there exists an (injective) sequence 
$B$ converging to $x$ such that $A\cap B$ is infinite for each $A \in \gamma$.
(One can always assume $B\subseteq\bigcup\gamma$.)

Equivalently, the same condition holds with the additional requirement that the sequences in $\gamma$ are pairwise disjoint. (The equivalence follows from Lemma 1.2 in {{zb:0774.54019}}.)

Note: In the context of the definitions above, by "sequence" one has to understand an injective sequence,
and we identify it with its range, which is a countably infinite set $A$.
If one bijective enumeration of $A$ converges to $x$, all bijective enumerations of $A$ converge to $x$.
Convergence thus becomes a property of countably infinite sets,
with $A$ converging to $x$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains all but finitely many points of $A$.

The $\alpha_i$ properties for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$ (sometimes called "sheaf amalgamation properties")
are due to Arkhangel'skii ({{zb:0275.54004}}).
The definition stated here is as presented by Nyikos in {{zb:0774.54019}}.
