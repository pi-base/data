For every $x\in X$ and every sequence of countably infinite sets $S_1,S_2,\dots\subseteq X$ with
each $S_n$ converging to $x$, there is a countably infinite set $S\subseteq\bigcup_n S_n$
such that $S$ converges to $x$ and $S\cap S_n$ is infinite for all $n$.

Equivalently, the same condition holds with the additional requirement that the sets $S_n$
are pairwise disjoint. (The equivalence follows from Lemma 1.2 in {{zb:0774.54019}}.)

Terminology: A countably infinite set $A\subseteq X$ *converges to $x$*
if some (equivalently, all) bijective enumeration of $A$ converges to $x$;
that is, if every neighborhood of $x$ contains all but finitely many elements of $A$.

The definition above in terms of countably infinite sets follows {{zb:1348.54033}}.
One can also phrase the definition in terms of (injective) sequences of elements of $X$,
as done in {{zb:0774.54019}}.

The $\alpha_i$ properties for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$ (sometimes called "sheaf amalgamation properties")
are due to Arkhangel'skii ({{zb:0275.54004}}).
