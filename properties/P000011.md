A space in which a closed set and a point not contained in it
can be separated by open neighborhoods.
In other words, given a closed set $A$ and a point
$b \notin A$, there are disjoint open sets $O_A$ and $O_b$ containing $A$ and
$b$, respectively.

Equivalently, every point has a neighborhood base consisting of closed sets.

See Definition 14.1 and Theorem 14.3 in {{zb:1052.54001}}.
