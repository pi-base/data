The space has a development.

A *development* for a space $X$ is a sequence $\mathscr U_1,\mathscr U_2,\dots$
of open covers of $X$ such that at each $x\in X$
the collection $\{\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n):n=1,2,\dots\}$ is a local base.
Here, $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr U_n)=\bigcup\{U\in\mathscr U_n:x\in U\}$
is the star of $x$ with respect to $\mathscr U_n$.

*Note*: If $X$ has a development, one can always choose a development such that
each $\mathscr U_{n+1}$ is a refinement of $\mathscr U_n$.

See Definition 23.6 in {{zb:1052.54001}} and page 329 of {{zb:0684.54001}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
