The space cannot be partitioned into more than one and at most countably infinitely many nonempty closed sets.

Equivalently, $X$ is {P36} and cannot be written as a countably infinite union of pairwise disjoint nonempty closed sets.

Equivalently, every continuous map from $X$ to {S15} is constant. (This is easy to check using the fact that the codomain is countable and $T_1$, and each of its proper closed subsets is a finite union of singletons.)

Defined in Chapter 5, Section 4, Definition 5.15 of {{doi:10.1201/9781315274089}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- If a dense subspace of $X$ satisfies this property, so does $X$ (see Fact 3 in {{mathse:4975867}}).
- The continuous image of a {P189} space is {P189} (see Fact 2 in {{mathse:4975867}}).
