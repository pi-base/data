For every $x\in X$ and every sequence of pairwise disjoint countably infinite sets
$S_1,S_2,\dots\subseteq X$ with
each $S_n$ converging to $x$, there is a countably infinite set $S\subseteq\bigcup_n S_n$
such that $S$ converges to $x$ and $S\cap S_n$ is cofinite in $S_n$
(i.e., $S_n\setminus S$ is finite) for infinitely many $n$.

The requirement that the sequences be disjoint is important here.
Without it, one gets a property equivalent to {P210},
as explained in the discussion after Definition 1.1 of {{zb:1348.54033}}.

Terminology: A countably infinite set $A\subseteq X$ *converges to $x$*
if some (equivalently, all) bijective enumeration of $A$ converges to $x$;
that is, if every neighborhood of $x$ contains all but finitely many elements of $A$.

The definition above in terms of countably infinite sets follows {{zb:1348.54033}}.
One can also phrase the definition in terms of (injective) sequences of elements of $X$,
as done in {{zb:0774.54019}}.

This property was introduced by Nyikos in {{zb:0774.54019}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary.
- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does (see {{mathse:5123855}}).
- This property is preserved by finite products (see {{mathse:5122756}}).
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
