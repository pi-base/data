A space that is both {P141} and {P143}.  Equivalently, a space that is both {P142} and {P143}.

CGWH stands for "compactly generated weak Hausdorff".  Mentioned for example in {{mo:251490}}.

A good reference for these spaces is [N. Strickland, "The category of CGWH spaces"](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/StricklandCGHWSpaces.pdf).
