Every subspace is connected.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

- The open sets are totally ordered by inclusion.
- The closed sets are totally ordered by inclusion.
- The specialization preorder is total.

For proof of the equivalences and further characterizations, see section 12 of {{doi:10.5186/aasfm.1977.0321}}.
