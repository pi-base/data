Any two disjoint zero-sets are contained in disjoint clopen sets.

If $X$ is {P7}, this is equivalent to each of the following:

- (1) Every finite cover of $X$ by cozero sets has a finite refinement which is a partition of $X$ by clopen sets
(see definition p. 360 and Theorem 6.2.4 in {{zb:0684.54001}}).

- (2) The Stone–Čech compactification $\beta X$ is {P50}
(see Theorems 16.11 and 16.17 in {{zb:0093.30001}}).

Some terminology used above:
A *zero-set* is a set of the form $f^{-1}(0)$ for some continuous $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$.
A *cozero set* is the complement of a zero-set.

Note: Engelking ({{zb:0684.54001}}) defines a "strongly zero-dimensional" space as being Tychonoff ({P7}),
nonempty, and satisfying condition (1) above.
Here we drop the {P7} and nonempty conditions.

In Charalambous ({{zb:1471.54001}}), the current property is denoted by $\operatorname{dim}_0 X=0$
without a specific name, and "strongly zero-dimensional" is used for a different, slightly stronger concept.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
