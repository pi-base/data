- Any two disjoint zero-sets are contained in disjoint clopen sets.

(Note: The clopen sets can always be chosen to be complement of each other.)

Equivalently:
- Every finite cozero cover of $X$ has a finite clopen refinement which is a partition of $X$
(see definition p. 360 and Theorem 6.2.4 in {{zb:0684.54001}}).

If $X$ is {P6}, this is also equivalent to:
- The Stone–Čech compactification $\beta X$ is {P50}
(see Theorems 16.11 and 16.17 in {{zb:0093.30001}}).

Some terminology used above:
A *zero-set* is a set of the form $f^{-1}(0)$ for some continuous $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$.
A *cozero set* is the complement of a zero-set.

Defined in section 6.2 of {{zb:0684.54001}} with the additional conditions that
$X$ be Tychonoff ({P6}) and non-empty.
Here we do not require these two conditions.

See also page 4 of {{doi:10.48550/arXiv.1306.6086}}.

The book {{zb:1471.54001}} uses "strongly zero-dimensional" with the meaning of non-empty {P218};
it does not give a name to the current notion, but treats it using the function $\dim_0$ in chapter 11.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
