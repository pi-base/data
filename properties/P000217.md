For any two disjoint zero-sets are contained in disjoint clopen sets.

We say $Z\subseteq X$ is a *zero-set* when $Z = f^{-1}(0)$ for some continuous $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$.

If $X$ is Tychonoff, then this is equivalent to $\beta X$ being zero-dimensional. (see theorem 16.11 and 16.17 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}})

Also see theorem 6.2.4 in {{zb:0684.54001}}.
