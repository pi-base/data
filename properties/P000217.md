Any two disjoint zero-sets are separated by a clopen set.

This is equivalent to the following:

- (1) Every finite cozero cover of $X$ has a finite clopen refinement which is a partition of $X$
(see definition p. 360 and Theorem 6.2.4 in {{zb:0684.54001}}).

Additionally if $X$ is Tychonoff, it's equivalent to the following:

- (2) The Stone–Čech compactification $\beta X$ is {P50}
(see Theorems 16.11 and 16.17 in {{zb:0093.30001}}).

Some terminology used above:
A *zero-set* is a set of the form $f^{-1}(0)$ for some continuous $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$.
A *cozero set* is the complement of a zero-set.

See section 6.2 of {{zb:0684.54001}}, particularly definition of strongly zero-dimensional and theorem 6.2.4. Note that we allow $X$ to be non-empty and don't require for it to be Tychonoff.

Also compare with definition of strongly zero-dimensional in chapter 2 of {{zb:1471.54001}}, {P218}, and function $\dim_0$ of chapter 11 of the same book.

Also see definition after proposition 7 of {{doi:10.48550/arXiv.1306.6086}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
