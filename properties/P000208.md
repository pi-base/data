A space for which every subspace is compact.

Equivalently:
- Every open subset is compact.
- The open sets satisfy the ascending chain condition: There is no infinite strictly increasing chain $O_1 \subsetneq O_2 \subsetneq \cdots$ of open sets.
- The closed sets satisfy the descending chain condition: There is no infinite strictly decreasing chain $Y_1 \supsetneq Y_2 \supsetneq \cdots$ of closed sets.
