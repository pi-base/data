Every subset of $X$ is compact.

Equivalently:
- Every open set is compact.
- The open sets satisfy the *ascending chain condition*: There is no infinite strictly increasing sequence $O_1 \subsetneq O_2 \subsetneq \cdots$ of open sets.
- The closed sets satisfy the *descending chain condition*: There is no infinite strictly decreasing sequence $Y_1 \supsetneq Y_2 \supsetneq \cdots$ of closed sets.
- Every nonempty collection of open sets has a maximal element.
- Every nonempty collection of closed sets has a minimal element.

Defined on page 5 of {{zb:1325.14001}}, and on page 248 of {{doi:10.1017/9781316543870}}. Also see the section on [Noetherian topological spaces](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0050) from the Stacks project.
