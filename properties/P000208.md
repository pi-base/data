A space for which every subspace is compact.

Equivalently:
- Every open subset is compact.
- The open sets satisfy the *ascending chain condition*: There is no infinite strictly increasing sequence $O_1 \subsetneq O_2 \subsetneq \cdots$ of open sets.
- The closed sets satisfy the *descending chain condition*: There is no infinite strictly decreasing sequence $Y_1 \supsetneq Y_2 \supsetneq \cdots$ of closed sets.
