The topology of $X$ has a base consisting of {P37} open sets.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

* The path components of every open set are open.

* $X$ is *locally path connected at $x$* for every $x\in X$;
that is, each $x$ has a neighborhood base consisting of open path connected sets.

* $X$ is *path connected im kleinen at $x$* for every $x\in X$;
that is, each $x$ has a neighborhood base consisting of (not necessarily open) path connected sets.

Note: In general, local path connectedness at a point $x$ is not equivalent to path connectedness im kleinen at $x$.
But the corresponding global statements (where the condition holds at every point) are equivalent.

For terminology and the equivalence between the conditions above, see section 2 of {{zb:1342.30054}} and {{wikipedia:Locally_connected_space}}, plus the references therein.

Defined on page 30 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.

Compare with {P43} and {P96}.
