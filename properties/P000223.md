name: Extent $\lt\mathfrak c$
---

A space with extent less than the cardinality of $\mathbb R$.

That is, there does not exist a closed discrete subset of cardinality $\mathfrak c$.

Equivalently, every set $S \subseteq X$ of cardinality $\mathfrak c$ has a limit point in $X$.

Compare with {P107}, {P21} and {P198}.
