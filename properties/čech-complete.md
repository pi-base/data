A space $X$ is Čech complete if it is $T_{3 \frac{1}{2}}$ and is a $G_\delta$ subset of some compactification of $X$.

Alternatively, $X$ is Čech complete iff there is a sequence $\mathcal{U}_0, \mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \dots$ of open covers of $X$ such that whenever $\mathcal{F}$ is a filter of closed sets such that for each $n$ there is some $F_n \in \mathcal{F}$ with $F_n \subset U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}_n$, then $\cap F \neq \emptyset$.
