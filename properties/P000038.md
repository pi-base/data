Given any two distinct points $x,y\in X$, there is an *injective path* in $X$ from $x$ to $y$;
that is, an injective continuous map $f:[0,1]\to X$ with $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$.

Compare with {P37}, which does not require the path to be injective,
and {P95}, which requires the path to be a homeomorphism onto its image.

Defined on page 29 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} with the name "arc connected".
Here we reserve that name for the stronger property {P95},
which is the more common usage in the literature.
