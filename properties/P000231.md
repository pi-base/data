Every point in $X$ has an open neighborhood $U$ so that the map $\pi_1(U) \to \pi_1(X)$
induced by the inclusion $U \hookrightarrow X$ is the zero map. Defined in {{zb:1044.55001}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets.
- $X$ satisfies this property if its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
