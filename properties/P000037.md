Given any two points $x,y\in X$, there is a *path* in $X$ from $x$ to $y$;
that is, a continuous map $f:[0,1]\to X$ with $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$.

Defined on page 29 of {{zb:0386.54001}}.

Compare with {P38} and {P95}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary products.
