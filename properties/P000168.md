Every {P57} subspace is {P52}.

Equivalently (see comments of {{mathse:4995501}}), every {P57}
subset is closed in the space.

Defined as "cid" in {{zb:0665.54003}} (pg. 283 of 
[https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN311571026_0039](https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN311571026_0039?tify=%7B%22pages%22%3A%5B299%5D%2C%22view%22%3A%22%22%7D))
with the weakening that only non-{P78} {P57} subspaces must
be {P52}.
