A space whose topology is the order topology for some total order on the underlying set.

If $X$ is a set and $<$ is a total order on $X$, the *order topology* on $(X,<)$ is generated by the subbase consisting of the open rays $(a,\to) = \{x\in X: a < x\}$ and $(\leftarrow, a) = \{x\in X: x < a\}$.

Defined on page 84 of {{zb:0951.54001}}, in 6D of {{zb:1052.54001}}, 1.7.4 of {{zb:0684.54001}}, and example 39 of {{zb:0386.54001}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is not hereditary with respect to open sets.
(Example: $(0,1)\cup\{2\}$ as a subspace of $[0,1]\cup\{2\}$)
- This property is not hereditary with respect to closed sets.
(Example: $(0,1)\cup\{3\}$ as a subspace of $(0,1)\cup(2,4)$)
- This property is hereditary with respect to order-convex sets. (see {{zb:0951.54001}}, Theorem 16.4, page 91).
- This property is hereditary with respect to (topologically) connected subsets. (Any connected subset of a LOTS is order-convex; see {{mathse:4968678}}.)
