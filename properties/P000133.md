A space whose topology is the order topology for some total order on the underlying set.

If $X$ is a set and $<$ is a total order on $X$, the order topology on $(X,<)$ is generated by the subbase consisting of the open rays $(a,\to) = \{x\in X: a < x\}$ and $(\leftarrow, a) = \{x\in X: x < a\}$.

Defined on page 84 of {{zb:0951.54001}}, in 6D of {{zb:1052.54001}}, 1.7.4 of {{zb:0684.54001}}, and example 39 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
