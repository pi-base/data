All points except for one are isolated.

Equivalently, the topology is not {P52} and is equal to or finer than an excluded point topology (e.g. {S12}).

There have been various slightly different definitions of *almost discrete" in the literature.  Most definitions exclude discrete spaces; see for example {{zb:0791.54049}} and {{zb:1542.54005}}.  Sometimes {P3} is assumed, but we don't make that assumption here.

Compare with {P202}.
