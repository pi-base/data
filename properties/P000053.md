The topology on the space $X$ is induced by some metric $d$.

A *metric* is a function $d:X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x,y,z \in X$,
(i) $d(x,y) \geq 0$ and $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$;
(ii) $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$;
(iii) $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$.

Given a metric $d$ and $x \in X$, $\epsilon>0$, define $B(x,\epsilon) = \{y \in X: d(x,y)<\epsilon\}$. Then the sets $B(x,\epsilon)$ form a base for a topology, called the topology induced by $d$.

#### Meta-properties

- The Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ is {P53} iff $X$ is {P121}.
- This property is hereditary.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions (see {{mathse:472003}}).
