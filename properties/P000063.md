A {P6} space that is a $G_\delta$ set in some compactification of $X$ (equivalently, in every compactification of $X$).

Equivalently, there is a sequence $\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \dots$ of open covers of $X$ such that whenever $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of closed sets with the finite intersection property and such that for each $n$ there is some $F_n \in \mathcal{F}$ with $F_n \subseteq U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}_n$, then $\bigcap \mathcal F \neq \emptyset$.

See Section 3.9 of {{mr:1039321}}, specifically Theorems 3.9.1 and 3.9.2 for the equivalences above.
