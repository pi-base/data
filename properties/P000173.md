A space in which every radially closed set is closed, where a set $A\subseteq X$ is *radially closed* if it contains the limits of all convergent transfinite sequences consisting of points of $A$.  In other words, for every non-closed set $A\subseteq X$ there is a point $p\in \overline A\setminus A$ and a transfinite sequence $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha<\lambda}$ of points of $A$ that converges to $p$.  (Here $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal and can always be taken to be a regular cardinal.)
