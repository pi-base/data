A topological space $X$ is called an _Alexandrov space_ (or a _finitely generated space_) if the family of open sets is closed under arbitrary intersections. Equivalently, $X$ is Alexandrov if any of the following properties hold.

* Each $x \in X$ has a unique smallest neighborhood.
* For each $A \subseteq X$, $A$ is open iff $A \cap Y$ is open in the subspace $Y$ for each finite $Y \subseteq X$.
* There is a quasi-order (_i.e._, a reflexive and transitive relation) $\preceq$ on $X$ such that for each $A \subseteq X$, $A$ is open iff for $\{ y \in X : y \preceq x \} \subseteq A$ for each $x \in X$.
