An arbitrary intersection of open sets is open.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

* An arbitrary union of closed sets is closed.
* Each $x \in X$ has a smallest neighborhood.
* $X$ is *finitely generated*:
For each $A \subseteq X$, $A$ is open iff $A \cap Y$ is open in the subspace $Y$ for each finite $Y \subseteq X$.
* There is a preorder (i.e., a reflexive and transitive relation) $\preceq$ on $X$ such that the open sets are precisely the upward closed sets (i.e., sets $A\subseteq X$ such that $x\in A$ and $x\preceq y$ imply $y\in A$).
