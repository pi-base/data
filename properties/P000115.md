Every open cover of $X$ has a $\sigma$-discrete closed refinement.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

- Every open cover of $X$ has a $\sigma$-locally finite closed refinement.

- Every open cover of $X$ has a $\sigma$-closure preserving closed refinement.

- For every open cover $\mathscr U$ of $X$, there is a sequence $\left<\mathscr V_n : n \in \omega\right>$ of open covers where each $\mathscr V_n$ is a refinement of $\mathscr U$ and, for each $x \in X$, there is some $n$ with $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr V_n)\subseteq U$ for some $U\in\mathscr U$.

- For every open cover $\mathscr U$ of $X$, there is a sequence $\left<\mathscr V_n : n \in \omega\right>$ of open covers where each $\mathscr V_n$ is a refinement of $\mathscr U$ and, for each $x \in X$, there is some $n$ with $\operatorname{ord}(x,\mathscr V_n)=1$.

Some of the terms used above: 
For some topological property $\mathcal P$, a collection of sets is called $\sigma$-$\mathcal P$ if it is a countable union of collections, each satisfying $\mathcal P$.
For $\mathscr W$ a collection of subsets of $X$, $\mathscr W$ is *closure preserving*
if for each $\mathscr W'\subseteq\mathscr W$,
$\overline{\bigcup\mathscr W'}=\bigcup\{\overline U:U\in\mathscr W'\}$.
Also, $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathscr W)=\bigcup\{W\in\mathscr W:x\in W\}$
and $\operatorname{ord}(x,\mathscr W)=|\{W\in\mathscr W:x\in W\}|$.

See Theorem 3.1 in {{zb:0569.54022}}
(the whole chapter assumes {P3}, but that property is not used to show the equivalences)
and Theorem V.7 on p. 217 in {{zb:0598.54001}}.
See also {{zb:0569.54022}} for references and original names for the properties when they were first introduced.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
