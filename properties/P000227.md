$X$ has a discrete closed set of cardinality $\mathfrak c=2^{\aleph_0}$.

*Note*: Discrete closed sets are exactly the sets with no limit point in $X$.

Compare with these properties, where $D$ denotes a discrete closed set in $X$:
- {P107} $(\exists D: |D|=1)$
- {P21} $(\forall D: |D|<\aleph_0)$
- {P198} $(\forall D: |D|\le\aleph_0)$
