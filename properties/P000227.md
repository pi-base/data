name: Has a discrete closed subset of size $\mathfrak c$
---

$X$ has a discrete closed set of cardinality $\mathfrak c=2^{\aleph_0}$.

*Note*: The discrete closed sets are exactly the subsets with no limit point in $X$.

*Note*: This property implies $e(X)\ge\mathfrak c$,
where the *extent* $e(X)$ is the supremum of the cardinality of discrete closed sets in $X$.
But, under certain set-theoretic assumptions (for example, if $\mathfrak c=\aleph_{\omega_1}$),
there are spaces with $e(X)=\mathfrak c$ and without discrete closed set of cardinality $\mathfrak c$,
i.e., where the supremum is not attained.

Compare with these properties, where $D$ denotes a discrete closed set in $X$:
- {P107} $(\exists D: |D|=1)$
- {P21} $(\forall D: |D|<\aleph_0)$
- {P198} $(\forall D: |D|\le\aleph_0)$
