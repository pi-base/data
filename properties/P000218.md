Any two disjoint closed sets are contained in disjoint clopen sets.

(Note: The clopen sets can always be chosen to be complement of each other.)

Equivalently, every finite open cover of $X$ has a finite clopen refinement which is a partition of $X$.

The book {{zb:1471.54001}} uses "strongly zero-dimensional"
for a space that is {P218} and non-empty (see page 9); {P218} is equivalent to either one of $\dim(X), \text{Ind}(X)$ or $\text{Ind}_0(X)$ being $\leq 0$. See chapters 2 and 13 for definitions of $\dim, \text{Ind}, \text{Ind}_0$.
