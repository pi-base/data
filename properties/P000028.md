A space with a countable local basis at every point.

Defined on page 7 of {{zb:0386.54001}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary.
- A space that is locally {P28} (every point has a neighborhood with the property)
has the property.
- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by countable products. (Corollary 2.3.14 in {{zb:0684.54001}})
