The topology of $X$ has a base consisting of {P36} open sets.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

* The connected components of every open set are open.

* $X$ is *locally connected at $x$* for every $x\in X$;
that is, each $x$ has a neighborhood base consisting of open connected sets.

* $X$ is *connected im kleinen at $x$* for every $x\in X$;
that is, each $x$ has a neighborhood base consisting of (not necessarily open) connected sets.

Note: In general, local connectedness at a point $x$ is not equivalent to connectedness im kleinen at $x$.
But the corresponding global statements (where the condition holds at every point) are equivalent.

For terminology and the equivalence between the conditions above, see section 2 of {{zb:1342.30054}} and {{wikipedia:Locally_connected_space}}, plus the references therein.
