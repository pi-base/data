A space with a $\sigma$-locally finite $k$-network.

A family $\mathcal N$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *$k$-network* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K\subseteq U$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq \mathcal{N}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq U$.  The family $\mathcal N$ is *$\sigma$-locally finite* if it is a countable union of locally finite families.

See for example Definition 2.1 in {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2015.05.085}}.
