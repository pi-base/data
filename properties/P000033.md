Every countable open cover of the space has a point-finite open refinement.

Equivalently (*Ishikawa's characterization*),
for any nested sequence of closed sets $F_0 \supseteq F_1 \supseteq \cdots$ with empty intersection,
there exist open sets $U_n \supseteq F_n$ for each $n$ such that the $U_n$ have empty intersection.

(One can choose the $U_n$ to be nested if desired.)

For a proof of the equivalence, see the Corollary in {{zb:0066.41001}}.

Defined on page 23 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
