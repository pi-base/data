For all $x \in X$, there is a descending sequence of subsets $(V_n(x))_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $x \in V_n$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that $O \subseteq X$ is open iff for all $x \in O$ there is a $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $V_n(x)\subseteq O$.

See Definition 2.3 in {{zb:0171.43603}}. This property is called g-first countable in {{zb:0285.54022}}.
