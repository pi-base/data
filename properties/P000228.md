One can choose for each $x\in X$ a decreasing sequence $\mathcal T_x=(V_n(x))_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of subsets of $X$ containing $x$, such that the family $\{\mathcal T_x:x\in X\}$ satisfies:

$\quad$A subset $U\subseteq X$ is open in $X$ iff for every $x\in U$ there is some $n$ such that $V_n(x)\subseteq U$.

*Note*: The family $\{\mathcal T_x:x\in X\}$ is a special case of a *weak base* for $X$.  See the references for details.

See Definition 2.3 in {{zb:0171.43603}}. This property is called *g-first countable* in {{zb:0285.54022}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
