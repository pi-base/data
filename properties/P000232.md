The definition used in {{zb:1044.55001}} is that $X$ is {P37} and, for each point $x \in X$, $\pi_1(X, x) \simeq 0$.
Equivalently, fix a point $p \in S^1$.
Then $X$ is simply connected if every map $S^1 \to X$ is homotopic to a constant map, by a homotopy
$H: X \times [0, 1] \to X$ satisfying $H(p, t) = H(p, 0)$ for all times $t \in [0, 1]$.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is hereditary with respect to open sets.
- $X$ satisfies this property if its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
