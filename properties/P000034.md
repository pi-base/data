Every open cover of $X$ is normal.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

- Every open cover has an open star-refinement.

- Every open cover has an open barycentric refinement.

- Every open cover has a subordinate partition of unity.

- Every open cover has a locally finite subordinate partition of unity.

- $X$ is {P13} and {P30}.

The *star* $\text{St}(A, \mathcal{B})$ for $A\subseteq X$ and $\mathcal{B}$ a family of subsets of $X$, is the set $\bigcup\{B\in \mathcal{B} : B\cap A\neq\emptyset\}$. We say $\mathcal{V}$ is a *star-refinement* of $\mathcal{U}$ if $\mathcal{V}^\ast = \{\text{St}(V, \mathcal{V}): V\in\mathcal{V}\}$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{U}$. We say $\mathcal{V}$ is a *barycentric refinement* of $\mathcal{U}$ if $\mathcal{V}^\Delta = \{\text{St}(x, \mathcal{V}): x\in X\}$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{U}$.
We say $\mathcal{U}$ is a *normal cover* if there exists a sequence of open covers $(\mathcal{U}_n)$ such that $\mathcal U=\mathcal U_1$ and each $\mathcal{U}_{n+1}$ is a star-refinement of $\mathcal{U}_n$.
We say that a family of functions $(f_i)$ is a *partition of unity* if the $f_i:X\to [0, 1]$ are continuous and $\sum_i f_i = 1$. Here $(\sum_i f_i)(x) = \sum_i f_i(x)$ is defined as supremum over finite sums $f_{i_1}(x)+...+f_{i_k}(x)$. We say that a partition of unity $(f_i)$ is *subordinate* to a cover $(U_i)$ of $X$ if $\{x\in X : f_i(x) > 0\}\subseteq U_i$ for all $i$. We say that a partition of unity $(f_i)$ is *locally finite* when the cover consisting of sets $\{x\in X : f_i(x) > 0\}$ is locally finite.

See {{mathse:4862626}} for proof of the equivalences.

(Note: {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} defines this property on page 23 as "fully $T_4$".
Misleadingly, it also calls "star refinement" what all other major sources call a barycentric refinement.)
