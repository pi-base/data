A space in which every open cover has an open star refinement, where a *star refinement* of a cover $\mathcal V$ is a cover $\mathcal U$ such that for every $U\in\mathcal U$ the *star* $\operatorname{st}(U,\mathcal U)$ of $U$ is contained in some member of $\mathcal V$.

Equivalently, a space in which every open cover has an open barycentric refinement, where a *barycentric refinement* of a cover $\mathcal V$ is a cover $\mathcal U$ such that for every $x\in X$ the *star* $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathcal U)$ of $x$ is contained in some member of $\mathcal V$.

Here, the *star* $\operatorname{st}(A,\mathcal U)$ of a set $A$ with respect to $\mathcal U$ is the union of all the sets $U\in\mathcal U$ that intersect $A$.  And $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathcal U)=\operatorname{st}(\{x\},\mathcal U)$ for a point $x\in X$.

The equivalence between the two definitions follows from the fact that a barycentric refinement of a barycentric refinement is a star refinement, as stated in Problem 20B of {{mr:MR2048350}}.

{{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} defines this property on page 23 as "fully $T_4$".  Misleadingly, it also calls "star refinement" what all other major sources call a barycentric refinement.

[Henno Brandsma: On paracompactness, full normality and the like](http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/c/a/02.pdf) has useful information about this property.
