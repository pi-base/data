A space which satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:

1. Every open cover has an open star refinement, where a *star refinement* of a cover 
$\mathcal V$ is a cover $\mathcal U$ such that for every $U\in\mathcal U$ the *star* 
$\operatorname{st}(U,\mathcal U)$ of $U$ is contained in some member of $\mathcal V$.

2. Every open cover has an open barycentric refinement, 
where a *barycentric refinement* of a cover $\mathcal V$ is a cover $\mathcal U$ such that for every 
$x\in X$ the *star* $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathcal U)$ of $x$ is contained in some member of $\mathcal V$.

3. Every open cover has a subordinate partition of unity.

4. Every open cover is normal.

Here, the *star* $\operatorname{st}(A,\mathcal U)$ of a set $A$ with respect to $\mathcal U$ is the 
union of all the sets $U\in\mathcal U$ that intersect $A$.
And $\operatorname{st}(x,\mathcal U)=\operatorname{st}(\{x\},\mathcal U)$ for a point $x\in X$.

The equivalence between defintions 1 and 2 follows from the fact that a barycentric refinement
of a barycentric refinement is a star refinement, as stated in Problem 20B of {{zb:1052.54001}}.

{{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} defines this property on page 23 as "fully $T_4$".
Misleadingly, it also calls "star refinement" what all other major sources call a barycentric refinement.

Several other equivalent characterizations are given in {{mathse:4862626}}, including that {P34} is equivalent to a space being simultaneously {P13} and {P30}, generalizing the treatment from {{zb:0684.54001}} past the {P2} setting.

[Henno Brandsma: On paracompactness, full normality and the like](http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/c/a/02.pdf)
also has useful information about this property.
