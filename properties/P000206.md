Player 2 has a winning strategy in the *strong Choquet game* played on a nonempty space.

Let $V_{-1}=X$. During round $n<\omega$
of this game, Player 1 chooses a point $x_n$ with an open neighborhood $U_n\subseteq V_{n-1}$,
and Player 2 chooses some open neighborhood $V_n\subseteq U_n$ of $x_n$.

Player 2 wins this game provided $\bigcap\{U_n:n<\omega\}\not=\emptyset$.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
