Every nonempty irreducible (= {P39}) closed subset of $X$ is the closure of a point of $X$, not necessarily unique;
that is, every nonempty irreducible closed subset has at least one *generic point*.

See {P201} for several equivalent formulations.

Equivalently, the Kolmogorov quotient of the space is {P73}. (See {T512}.)

See for example Definition 5.8.6 in the section on [Irreducible components](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/004U) from the Stacks project,
or the paragraph after Definition 1.2 in {{doi:10.35834/mjms/1316032836}}.

Note: With an additional uniqueness condition on the generic points, the corresponding property is {P73}.
