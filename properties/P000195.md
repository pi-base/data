The space is {P16}, {P3}, and {P47}.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

- The space is {P16} and {P48}.
- The space is {P16}, {P1}, and {P50}.
- The space is {P75} and {P2}.

The equivalence follows from various theorems in pi-base.

Also known as *profinite* spaces, referring to the fact that such spaces are precisely the cofiltered limits of finite discrete spaces. See the section on [Profinite spaces](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08ZW) at the Stacks project.
