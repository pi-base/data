$X$ is {P37} and the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group) $\pi_1(X)$ is trivial. Defined on page 28 of {{zb:1044.55001}}.

Also called $1$-*connected*.  See [n-connected space in nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/n-connected+space).

Equivalently: 
- Every pair of points in $X$ is connected by a unique homotopy class of paths. See Proposition 1.6. of {{zb:1044.55001}}.
- $X$ is {P37} and every continuous map $S^1 \to X$ extends to a continuous map $D^2 \to X$. 
- $X$ is {P37} and every continuous map $S^1 \to X$ is homotopic to a constant map.

Defined on page 28 of {{zb:1044.55001}}. See {{mathse:4044399}} for additional equivalent characterizations.
