Every pair of points in $X$ is connected by a unique homotopy class of paths. (See Proposition 1.6. of {{zb:1044.55001}}.)

This is equivalent to each of the following:
- $X$ is {P37} and every continuous map $S^1 \to X$ extends to a continuous map $D^2 \to X$. 
- $X$ is {P37} and every continuous map $S^1 \to X$ is homotopic to a constant map.

In case $X\ne\emptyset$, it is equivalent to the usual formulation:
- $X$ is {P37} and the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group) $\pi_1(X)$ is trivial.

*Note*: The fundamental group is undefined for the empty space.

Also called $1$-*connected* if $X\ne\emptyset$.  See [n-connected space in nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/n-connected+space).

Defined on page 28 of {{zb:1044.55001}}. See {{mathse:4044399}} for additional equivalent characterizations.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary products.
