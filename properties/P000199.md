$X$ is [homotopy equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#Homotopy_equivalence) to {S162}.

Equivalently: 
- $X \neq \emptyset$ and the identity map of $X$ is [homotopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#Formal_definition) to a constant map.
- For every nonempty space $Y$, any map $Y \to X$ is homotopic to a constant map.

Defined on page 4 of {{zb:1044.55001}}.
