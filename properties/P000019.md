Every countable open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.

Equivalently, every infinite set in $X$ has an $\omega$-accumulation point in $X$.

Equivalently, every sequence in $X$ has an accumulation point in $X$ (that is, a point such that each of its neighborhoods contains infinitely many terms of the sequence). {{wikipedia:Countably_compact_space}} lists it as condition (3) for being an equivalence to countable compactness.

Defined on page 19 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
