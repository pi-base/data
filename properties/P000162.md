A space $X$ that is homeomorphic to a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^\kappa$ for some cardinal $\kappa$.

Equivalently (see {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}), $X$ is {P6} and every real $z$-ultrafilter $\mathcal U$ on the space $X$ is fixed,
that is $\bigcap\mathcal{U}\neq\emptyset$.
A $z$-ultrafilter is an ultrafilter on the lattice of zero-sets of $X$ (see {{wikipedia:Ultrafilter}} for more general definition of an ultrafilter). A real $z$-ultrafilter is a $z$-ultrafilter with countable intersection property, that is for any countable $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{U}$ we have $\bigcap\mathcal{F}\neq \emptyset$.
