There exists a basis for the topology that is also a partition into disjoint sets.

This is equivalent to each of the following:

- Every open set is closed.
- Every closed set is open.
- The space's Kolmogorov quotient is {P52}.
- The space is the disjoint union of a collection of {P129} spaces.

For proof of the equivalences and further characterizations, see section 13 of {{doi:10.5186/aasfm.1977.0321}}.
