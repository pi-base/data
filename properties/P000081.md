$X$ has *countable tightness*:
For each $A\subseteq X$ and each $p\in \overline A$ there is a countable subset $D\subseteq A$ such that $p\in \overline D$.

Equivalently, $X$ is *countably generated*:
For each $A\subseteq X$, $A$ is closed whenever $A\cap C$ is closed in $C$ for every countable $C\subseteq X$ (or the equivalent condition for open sets).

For a proof of the equivalence, see {{mathse:5086334}}.
