Every open cover has a star-finite open refinement.

A family $\mathscr A$ of subsets of $X$ is called *star-finite* if each element of $\mathscr A$ meets at most finitely many elements of $\mathscr A$.

Defined on p. 326 of {{zb:0684.54001}} together with the condition that the space is {P3}.  Here we do not assume any separation axiom as part of the definition.
