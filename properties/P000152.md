---
The second player has a Markov winning strategy in the Rothberger game $\mathsf{G}_1(\mathcal O_X,\mathcal O_X)$ (relying on only the round number and most recent move of the opponent). See pages 2 and 3 of {{zb:1431.54009}} for more details.

Equivalent conditions:

- Markov $\Omega$-Rothberger: The second player has a Markov winning strategy in the game $\mathsf{G}_1(\Omega_X,\Omega_X)$ (relying on only the round number and most recent move of the opponent). See pages 2 and 3 of {{zb:1431.54009}} for more details.

- Topologically countable: There is a set $\{ x_n : n \in \omega \} \subseteq X$ so that, for every $x \in X$, there is some $n \in \omega$ so that every neighborhood of $x_n$ contains $x$. See {{zb:1555.54009}} for more on this property.

The equivalence is shown in Theorem 4.17 of {{zb:1555.54009}} and also at {{mathse:4737285}}.
