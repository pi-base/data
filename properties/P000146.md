Every open cover of the space has an open (hence clopen) refinement partitioning the space. (We do not assume {P3}.)

Equivalently, every open cover of the space is refined by a locally finite clopen cover.  The equivalence between the two definitions is shown in Lemma 1.3 and Corollary 1.4 of {{zb:0182.25501}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
