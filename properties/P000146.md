Every open cover $\mathscr U$ of $X$ has an open (hence clopen) refinement $\mathscr V$ partitioning $X$.
(We do not assume {P3}.)

(Note: One can always choose the same index set for the two covers.
Given $\mathscr U=\{U_i:i\in I\}$, one can choose $\mathscr V=\{V_i:i\in I\}$ with $V_i\subseteq U_i$ for each $i$.)

Equivalently, every open cover of the space is refined by a locally finite clopen cover.

The equivalence between the two definitions is shown in Lemma 1.3 and Corollary 1.4 of {{zb:0182.25501}}.

#### Meta-properties

- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
