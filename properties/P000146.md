Every open cover of the space has an open (hence clopen) refinement partitioning the space. (We do not assume {P3}.)

Equivalently, every open cover of the space is refined by a locally finite clopen cover.  The equivalence between the two definitions is shown in Lemma 1.3 and Corollary 1.4 of {{mr:261565}} (<https://eudml.org/doc/161976>).
