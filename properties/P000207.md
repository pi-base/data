For each neighborhood $U$ of the diagonal $\Delta=\{(x,x)\mid x\in X\}$
in $X\times X$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of the diagonal such that
$V\circ V\subseteq U$.

In Theorem 2.6 of {{doi:10.2307/1993026}} this property was shown to be equivalent to
*almost $2$-fully normal*: each open cover $\mathcal U$ has an open almost $2$-star
refinement $\mathcal V$, that is $\mathcal{V}$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{U}$ and for any $x, y, z$ with $y, z\in \text{St}(x, \mathcal{V})$ there exists $U\in\mathcal{U}$ with $y, z\in U$.

Originally studied by Cohen in {{zb:0046.16403}}
(<http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3186w/f290.image>),
where it was shown to be
strictly stronger than {P88}.
