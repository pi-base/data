The topology of $X$ has a base consisting of {P38} open sets.

Equivalently, every point has a local base of {P38} open neighborhoods.

Compare with {P42} and {P96}.

Defined on page 30 of {{zb:0386.54001}} with the name "locally arc connected".
Here we reserve that name for the stronger property {P96}.
