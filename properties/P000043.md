The topology of $X$ has a base consisting of {P38} open sets.

Equivalently, every point has a local base of {P38} open neighborhoods.

Compare with {P42} and {P96}.

Defined on page 30 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} with the name "locally arc connected".
Here we reserve that name for the stronger property {P96}.

##### WARNING:

The properties {P43} and {P96}
are currently being worked on.
Some spaces may have inaccurate or incorrect traits for these properties.
This is only temporary and will be corrected soon.
