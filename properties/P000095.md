Given any two distinct points $x,y\in X$, there is an *arc* in $X$ from $x$ to $y$;
that is, a homeomorphic embedding $f:[0,1]\to X$ with $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$.

See Definition 27.1 in {{zb:1052.54001}}, which uses the usual definition of "arc" from the literature.

Compare with {P37} and {P38}.

Note: Page 29 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} 
uses the terms "arc" for an injective path
and "arc connected" for the weaker property {P38}.

are currently being worked on.
Some spaces may have inaccurate or incorrect traits for these properties.
