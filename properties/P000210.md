$X$ is an $\alpha_1$ space if for all $x \in X$ 
and for all countable collections of sequences 
$\gamma$ converging to $x$ there exists a sequence 
$B$ converging to $x$ such that $A\setminus B$ is 
finite for all $A \in \gamma$.  

The $\alpha_i$ properties for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$ 
are due to Arkhangel’skii ({{zb:0275.54004}}), 
however the definition stated here is as presented 
by Nyikos in {{zb:0774.54019}}.
