For a set $X$, a function $d:X^2\to[0,\infty)$ is called a *symmetric*
if it satisfies reflexivity ($d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y$) and symmetry
($d(x,y)=d(y,x)$). A space $X$ is called *symmetrizable* if
there is a symmetric such that a subset $U \subseteq X$ is open iff for each $x \in U$,
there is some $\varepsilon > 0$ with $B(x,\varepsilon)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}$
being contained in $U$.

Equivalently, there exists a symmetric $d$ such that $Y \subseteq X$ is closed iff $d(p,Y)=\inf\{d(p,y):y\in Y\} > 0$ for all $p \in X \setminus Y$.

Defined in {{doi:10.2991/978-94-6239-216-8}}. Note that some sources, e.g., {{doi:10.2307/2370790}}, use the term semimetric
(see {P102}) to refer to a symmetric and the term semimetrizable to refer to {P104}.
