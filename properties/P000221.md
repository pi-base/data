The topology on the space $X$ is induced by a [complete uniformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space#Completeness) $\mathcal{U}$.

If $X$ is $T_0$ this is equivalent to the following (see {{zb:0684.54001}} exercise 8.5.13a):

2. $X$ is a closed subspace of a product of {P55} spaces
3. $X$ is a closed subspace of a product of {P53} spaces.

Compare with definition in 15.7 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}} where uniform structure is defined using pseudometrics instead.

This property is *topologically complete* in {{mr:370454}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
