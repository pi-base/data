The topology on the space $X$ is induced by a [complete uniformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space#Completeness) $\mathcal{U}$.

We call uniformity $\mathcal{U}$ complete if every Cauchy filter $\mathcal{F}$ on $(X, \mathcal{U})$ converges. Equivalently, every Cauchy net $(x_i)_{i\in I}$ on $(X, \mathcal{U})$ converges. Here Cauchy filter is a filter $\mathcal{F}$ such that for every $U\in\mathcal{U}$ there exists $A\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A\times A\subseteq U$. A Cauchy net is a net $(x_i)_{i\in I}$ such that for every $U\in\mathcal{U}$ there exists $i_0$ such that $(x_j, x_k)\in U$ for $j, k\geq i_0$.

If $X$ is $T_0$ this is equivalent to the following (see {{zb:0684.54001}} exercise 8.5.13a):

1. $X$ is a closed subspace of a product of {P55} spaces
2. $X$ is a closed subspace of a product of {P53} spaces.

Compare with definition in 15.7 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}} where uniform structure is defined using pseudometrics instead.

This property is *topologically complete* in {{mr:370454}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
