The topology on the space $X$ is induced by some complete uniformity $\mathcal{U}$.

For definition of complete uniformity see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space#Completeness>.

Compare with definition in 15.7 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}} where uniform structure is defined using pseudometrics instead.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
