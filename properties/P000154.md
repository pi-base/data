The space $X$ is {P2} and there is a linear order $<$ on $X$ such that every point
has a local base of order-convex neighborhoods.
(A subset $A$ of an ordered set $(X,<)$ is *order-convex* if for each $a,b\in A$ with $a<b$,
$A$ contains all points of $X$ between $a$ and $b$.)

Equivalently, there is a linear order $<$ on $X$ such that intervals $(a,b)=\{x:a<x<b\}$ are open,
and every point has a local base of order-convex neighborhoods.

Equivalently, $X$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of a {P133}.

For more details and the proof of these equivalences, see {{zb:0228.54026}} (<https://eudml.org/doc/268514>)
and {{mathse:4917398}}.

Such spaces are also called *suborderable* (as an example, in {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2017.09.030}}).
