---

Every cozero set $U$ in $X$ has a *cozero complement*, that is,
a cozero set $V$ disjoint from $U$ such that $U\cup V$ is dense in $X$.

A *cozero set* is a set of the form $\{x\in X:f(x)>0\}$ for some continuous function $f:X\to\mathbb R$;
equivalently, the complement of a zero set.

Defined in {{zb:1067.54015}}, with the additional usual assumption of {P6}.
We do not make that assumption here.

Note: For a {P6} space, being cozero complemented is equivalent to various algebraic
properties of the ring $C(X)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $X$.
See Theorem 1.3 in {{zb:1067.54015}}.

#### Meta-properties

- $X$ satisfies this property iff its Kolmogorov quotient $\text{Kol}(X)$ does.
- This property is hereditary with respect to cozero sets (see Lemma 1.5(b) in {{zb:1067.54015}}),
and in particular, with respect to clopen sets.
- This property is preserved by arbitrary disjoint unions.
